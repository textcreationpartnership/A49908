            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Tranſlator's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> is a Perſon ſo well known to all the learned World, that it could not be thought leſs arrogant than ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for me to give any Character of his Capacity or his Writings. Nor can it be ſaid that I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs either way in recommending the following Treatiſe; for, ſetting aſide all perſonal Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, the Subject of it is enough to juſtify my <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking. The Study of Religion in general is ſo natural to Man, that ſome would make this Inclination to paſs for the only eſſential Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Species from all other Animals. But the Study of the true Religion muſt needs be of the higheſt Importance, ſince the Profeſſion of it is not acknowledg'd to be more neceſſary, than the Sects pretending themſelves to be the only Perſons enjoying that Happineſs, are found to be different from one another in their Opinions and Practices. This Diverſity join'd to the great number of Parties that lay their Claim to genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine Chriſtianity excluſively of all the reſt, ſeems to render the Diſcovery of the Truth very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, if not impoſſible; And indeed thouſands of well-meaning People have upon this very account given up themſelves to Scepticiſm and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in Matters of Religion; or, which is as bad, are content to be implicitely led by their Teachers. Now that Perſon deſerves beſt of the World who not only makes the Truth plain and intelligible, ſeparating it from all the falſe Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with which it is ſo mix'd and over-run ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as to endanger the entire Ruin thereof; but who likewiſe eſtabliſhes ſuch an excellent Method
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:59986:3"/>that a Man may be moſt certain he's on the right ſide, without being oblig'd to undergo the endleſs labour of examining every Religion ſucceſſively. How far our Author has contributed to do Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind this deſirable piece of Service, the Reader muſt determine; for we pretend not to lead his Judgment. And tho Mr. <hi>Le Clerc</hi> is ſo modeſt as to think his own Performance inferiour to that of <hi>Grotius</hi> upon the ſame Subject, I muſt affirm, (and that with all imaginable Impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) that in my Opinion there is no Compariſon to be made between them; for were it for nothing elſe but that the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Le Clerc</hi>'s Reaſons is obvious to Men of all Conditions, whereas moſt of the other's Book is not intelligible but to profound Scholars, (as if theſe only had a Right to the Privilege of underſtanding the Grounds of their Religion) this alone is ſufficient to decide the Controverſy. But what is more, notwithſtanding the extraordinary Talents of <hi>Grotius,</hi> he was not near ſo great a Maſter of the Oriental Languages, nor ſo acute and ſolid a Philoſopher; nor yet ſuperior in Philology or Hiſtory; to ſpeak nothing of the Advantages of writing after him. But let Mr. <hi>Le Clerc</hi>'s Book ſpeak for its Author. As for my Verſion, I ſhan't detain the Reader with any Apology, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not more correct or polite, if it be faithful and intelligible, which is all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for thoſe who ſincerely ſtudy for Truth: and if I be ſo happy as to ſatisfy them, I care not much for the Diſpleaſure of others.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>'TIS ſome Years ſince I firſt form'd a Deſign of writing upon the Subject of this ſmall Piece, which I publiſh at preſent; and had my other Occupations purely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon my own Choice, this had been perform'd long ago: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſarily engag'd in ſome other things, I was forc'd to put it off till now. At length having finiſh'd my Latin Writings upon the Pentateuch, I happily became Maſter of Time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to turn my Applications upon this Subject. I can freely ſay, that I never thought of Matters of this nature without extreme Satisfaction; for, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner ſoever I could conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Chriſtian Religion, it always appear'd to me grounded upon the firmeſt Proofs, and the Doctrines of it perfectly conformable to ſound Reaſon, or (to ſay all in one word) worthy the Creator of Heaven and Earth. Nor did I in my whole Life labour with more ardour and delight than I did in compoſing this Work, wherein I have,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:59986:4"/>I think, evidently made out that Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers act againſt all good Senſe in refuſing their Aſſent to the Goſpel: and I perſwade my ſelf, that if they conſider the ſame things that I have, they muſt neceſſarily acknowledg the Truth of it. But whether I'm miſtaken or not, that the World ſhall judg. If this Book have the good luck to meet with that Reception in French, which ſeveral others of this kind have had, I may one time or other put it into La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin; and in my Annotations upon it confirm all that I ſay by the Authority of the moſt antient Apologiſts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and that too of the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering Heathens; as the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Grotius</hi> has done in his Books of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. I'm far indeed from equalling my Work to his, nor do I flatter my ſelf with the ſame Succeſs, as to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the publick: but if Men had regard only to the Intentions of thoſe that write, I think I may ſafely ſay that none in the World had better than mine, nor was more convinc'd of the Goodneſs of that Cauſe I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to defend.</p>

            <head>OF INCREDULITY.</head>
            <head type="sub">The PREFACE, Containing the Deſign of the Author in this Work.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Cannot determine whether, during the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, more Books were written by the Chriſtians to evince the Truth of their Religion, than there may have been for theſe two hundred Years paſt. But that we have fewer remaining of the precedent Ages than of the laſt two, is moſt certain. The Teachers of the Primitive Church and their Followers, whilst Paganiſm was ſtill conſiderable in the World, labour'd more in confuting the Religion of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, than to prove the Truth of that of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles. They thought if they could once convince the Heathens of the Falſity of their own Opinions, that it would be no hard Matter then to make 'em Chriſtians.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59986:6"/>And this I could moſt eaſily ſhew, were it at all uſeful to my Deſign.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, when Paganiſm was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd in <hi>Europe,</hi> and Chriſtianity become the governing Religion, the Teachers of it then left Paganiſm to attack the Religion of the Jews, and that of the Mahumetans, both which are yet in being amongst us. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide theſe two ſorts of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, there is yet a third, who, acknowledging the Falſity of the Mahumetan and Rabbinic Doctrines, doubt notwithſtanding of the Chriſtian Religion, or peremptorily judg it not true, without ſetting up any other Religion in its Place. Now to reduce theſe, a new Method was abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. It was agreed therefore to prove di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly the Truth of Chriſtianity, without inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Confutation of other Perſwaſions. And it may truly be ſaid, to the Honour of the preſent Age, and of that immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding it, that this Matter was never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd with better Succeſs. The Heathens, the Jews, and the Mahumetans were not ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed before, but the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion was far from being ever ſo well prov'd.</p>
            <p>I am of Opinion nevertheleſs, that there is ſtill one thing behind, which the moſt part of the Writers upon this Subject have either not touch'd at all, or but very ſlightly; I mean, <hi>the ſecret Motives and general Reaſons which the Incredulous have of not believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtianity to be divinely reveal'd.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59986:6"/>Their internal Diſpoſition or Inclinations do ſo ſtrongly incline them to reject all the Reaſons offer'd them, (tho they are not aware them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the Motives by which they do this) that all ſpeaking to 'em is in vain, before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonableneſs of this Diſpoſition be made evident. Juſt as if any ſhould plead a good Cauſe before prepoſſeſs'd Judges, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to cure them firſt of their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, which muſt needs make them look upon that thing as falſe, whereupon all the Reaſons alledg'd are grounded. 'Tis certain, that the Pleaders of ſuch a Cauſe, tho never ſo juſt, would expoſe themſelves to be caſt or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd. This has been notwithſtanding the Conduct of a great Part of the Champions of Chriſtianity. They have prov'd the Truth of it well enough, but their Reaſons appear weak to the Incredulous, conſidering the Diſpoſition wherein they are, and whereof they know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing themſelves. What is unreaſonable therefore in this Diſpoſition muſt be diſcover'd, and laid ſo clearly before them, that they may perceive how it impoſes upon the Light of their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings.</p>
            <p>This is what the Author of the Chriſtian Religion has taught us, when he ſaid, that <hi>every one that doth Evil hateth the Light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3.20.</note> 
               <hi>neither cometh to the Light, leſt his Deeds ſhould be reproved:</hi> which ſignifies that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers cannot look upon that as true which is contrary to the Maxims by which they have long govern'd themſelves, and to the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59986:7"/>Habits they have been contracting for many Years. On the contrary he ſays, that <hi>he that doth Truth cometh to the Light,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 21.</note> 
               <hi>that his Deeds may be made manifeſt:</hi> that is to ſay, that ſuch as are diſpos'd to live according to the Preſcriptions of the Goſpel, are eaſily perſwaded of the Truth of it. In the ſame Senſe he ſays elſewhere, that <hi>if any will do his Will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 7.17.</note> 
               <hi>he ſhall know of the Doctrine whether it be of God, or whether of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſide the Diſpoſition wherein thoſe may be who disbelieve the Goſpel, and which deceives them without their perceiving of it, there are likewiſe certain general Reaſons drawn from without that help to lead them into Error. Theſe Reaſons muſt by all means be exploded, becauſe they are to them ſo many Prejudices whereby they determine the Truth and Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of all that is ſaid to them. Whilst they think 'em good, all the Proofs imaginable can make no Impreſſion upon them; becauſe they never fail of oppoſing to them theſe Reaſons, which concluding to be ſolid, they cannot at the ſame time embrace Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>There are a world of People, for example, who, diſcovering ſeveral of thoſe Doctrines that go under the Name of Chriſt to be falſe, judg of the reſt by theſe, and reject the good with the bad. They are told of a thouſand ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miracles, to whom thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles are join'd: but finding the modern Miracles to be Impoſtures, they give
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59986:7"/>no greater Credit to thoſe upon which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is grounded.</p>
            <p>As long as they are of the mind that theſe Miracles are not more certain one than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all the Conſequences drawn from thoſe of Chriſt appear to them as built upon a rotten Foundation, and the Chriſtian Religion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but as a tottering Fabrick. It muſt be ſhewn the Incredulous then, that thoſe Reaſons drawn from without which induce them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Goſpel, have no Solidity in them: and after this it may be hop'd that the Proofs of its Truth may have ſome Effect upon their Minds.</p>
            <p>I deſign to proceed according to this Method in the preſent Diſcourſe, where, after having examin'd the inward Diſpoſition of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and alſo ſhewing the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, I ſhall diſcover the Weakneſs of thoſe Arguments drawn from without, by which they judg of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Before I begin I muſt once more advertiſe my Reader, that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers which I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack are neither the Jews nor the Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, but thoſe, who, making an outward Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, conceal in the mean time their real Thoughts from the World; but when they think to do it without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59986:8"/>Danger, they declare to their Friends in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, that they believe not the Truth of it. Not but that the Pagans, Jews, and Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans are frequently guilty of the ſame Faults with thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers whereof I treat; but it would be Labour in vain to trouble our ſelves with ſuch as never read the Writings of the Chriſtians; and who, becauſe of their Prejudices, are in a manner uncapable of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning rightly. I write merely for the ſake of thoſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers among Chriſtians into whoſe Hands this Book is like to come, or for ſuch as may happen to be ſeduc'd by their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>Beſide this ſort of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reject whatever is ſaid to be reveal'd, there is yet another kind of Men infinitely more numerous, who are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers by halves, and to whom many things in this Work may be properly apply'd. Theſe own in general, that the Goſpel is true, but will be ſure to admit of no Particular therein that is abſolutely incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with their own Inclinations or Habits. Such Doctrines they cannot perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be Evangelick, which is almoſt the ſame thing as if they rejected half the New Teſtament, or rather entirely renounc'd it; ſeeing that Jeſus Chriſt will not have the Heart to be thus divided between himſelf and the World.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59986:8"/>
            <p>Whilst I prove againſt them who reject all the Chriſtian Religion, that their Diſpoſitions or Inclinations cannot be the Rule of Truth and Falſhood, I ſhew to thoſe half-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they groſly impoſe upon themſelves in receiving nothing of the Goſpel, but only what ſerves their turn.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> I don't pretend to have exhauſted the Subject I treat of. An infinite Number of Caſes or Queſtions may be rais'd about Matters of this nature, without any poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of examining them all. And there may be, I deny not, even ſome general Maxims forgotten by me, which cannot be commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reduc'd to thoſe I have laid down, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy nevertheleſs to be diſcuſs'd, and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my Deſign. But this others may do, if they think fit; or I may do it one day my ſelf, if I ſhould ever enlarge this Work.</p>
            <p>I have purpoſely ſaid in the Title-Page, <hi>that I examin'd the general Reaſons of Unbelievers,</hi> that the Anſwers to many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Objections they are wont to make may not be expected in this Book. They muſt be look'd after in Syſtems of Theology, or in the Commentators upon the Holy Scripture. But I'll preſume to ſay, that theſe particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections are to be little fear'd, when once all general Difficulties are remov'd out of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59986:9"/>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, becauſe the ſame Principles that anſwer the one, may ſerve to ſolve the other; or, at leaſt, prevent their having any ill Effect, if they cannot be anſwer'd; as it may be ſeen in the ſecond Part of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>

               <p>HAD Men been pure Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, ſolely applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Search of Truth and Falſhood, diſpos'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate their Lives according to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries they ſhould make, and all this without cauſing to them any Pain or Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; there could be no other thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, than to cure them of their Errors, or to reform their Conduct, but only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate thoſe Truths to them whereof
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59986:10"/>they were ignorant before, and to ſhew that they liv'd not accordingly. But the Judgments which Men form of moſt Things, depend as much upon the Habits they have contracted, and which they cannot eaſily correct, as upon the Light of their Underſtanding, and Ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Such as are accuſtom'd, for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to live idly, never thinking of any thing that is uſeful, and that can thus paſs away their Time without any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Poverty; theſe, I ſay, look upon all Reaſons offer'd for Pains-taking or Study, to be only the Diſcourſes of moroſe People, who are Strangers to the Enjoyments of Life. The ſtrongeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove that every one is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to be ſome way uſeful to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety whereof he's a Member, appear to ſuch without any Foundation; tho others judg 'em demonſtrative. But how comes this to paſs? 'Tis becauſe the Habit they have got of living in Idleneſs, keeps them from attentively conſidering what is ſaid; for they fix their Thoughts upon quite contrary Idea's, the Remembrance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is at the ſame time very grateful to them. They think upon that ſoft Indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, and that pleaſing Lazineſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ſpent the beſt of their days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Chagrin; and their Minds are ſo taken up with theſe Contemplations, that there is no room left for any thing leſs agreeable.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59986:10"/>
               <p>As much may be ſaid of all good and ill Habits of a long continuance, as it muſt be granted by all that are capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the leaſt Reflection; and this Truth every Perſon has learn'd a thouſand times from Experience, or may do it when he will.</p>
               <p>Some body, perhaps, that has not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſtudy'd the Heart of Man, will be apt to ſay, that when a Habit is found to be evil, it ought to be preſently chang'd into a good one. This is indeed moſt eaſily ſaid, but nothing more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to practiſe. When a Man is us'd to a certain manner of Living and Thinking, it muſt be own'd that he takes Pleaſure in it; for this is the neceſſary effect of all Habits: Now when once a thing is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with Pleaſure, we cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear loving it; and whilſt we thus love it, there is no leaving of it without great Strugglings, and putting an extreme Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon our Inclinations.</p>
               <p>As the Habits we already have, were contracted by degrees; ſo a great deal of time is requiſite to acquire others: for as there is need of Time to deſtroy an old Habit, ſo there is likewiſe to form a new one. For if to be undeceiv'd in any thing, it were only neceſſary to liſten like pure Spirits, we ſhould in one quarter of an Hour run from one Extreme to the other. Nothing makes Time neceſſary in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59986:11"/>order to become Vertuous, but becauſe we are unwilling to be ſo: and did we deſire it, we ſhould quickly learn to live honeſtly and happily. <hi>Longam facit ope<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ram, quod repugnamus: Erevis est inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio vitae honeſtae beataeque, ſi credas.</hi> Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til. Inſt. Orat. lib. 12. c. 6.</p>
               <p>Should it happen then that we ha<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Habits quite contrary to ſuch as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion requires of Men, they would certainly diſpoſe us to look upon every thing which that Religion does teach to b<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> falſe, and to refuſe Submiſſion to it<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Laws. I don't ſay yet, that thoſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Diſpoſitions to the Goſpel are good or bad; but I deſire only the Suppoſition which I now made to be granted me: and I think none can deny me this, without denying at the ſame time what I laid down at the Beginning, concerning the Influence our Habits have over our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, with the Difficulty of conquering them. But theſe are Truths ſo evident to all the World, that there's no Poſſibility of diſagreeing from them.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, behold the Picture of Man that rejects the Chriſtian Religion becauſe it is contrary to his preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, however he came by it. He's a Man that ſays to himſelf, All that is taught by this Religion is falſe, becauſe it is repugnant to my Condition. I'm too honeſt a Man to deſerve Damnation; but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59986:11"/>this muſt nevertheleſs be, were the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion true: It is therefore falſe, and I ſhall never believe it.</p>
               <p>'Tis abſurd, ſome will ſay, to ſuppoſe a Man's Diſpoſition to be good, without any other Proof, but that to believe the contrary is a troubleſome thing, and that one is oblig'd to condemn himſelf. No body, ſay they, can reaſon after this manner, unleſs it be ſome Fool. I grant it; but there are many more Fools of this ſort than we imagine. Such as believe their own Sentiments to be the only true ones in the World, (and theſe are almoſt all Mankind) what Judgment do they make of thoſe, who, without examining, reject them? Do they not conclude, that ſuch as act in that manner, being well pleas'd with their own Condition, judg every thing true that agrees with it, and the contrary falſe?</p>
               <p>'Tis true, nevertheleſs, that no body reaſons formally ſo, diſtinctly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every Propoſition, and their Conne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with one another. No Perſon makes this formal Paralogiſm: I'm an honeſt Man; what is contrary to the Idea's and the Conduct of an honeſt Man is falſe; therefore the Chriſtian Religion, which is contrary to my Idea's and Conduct, is falſe. But 'tis certain, that the Mind ſuppoſing the two firſt Propoſitions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expreſly reflecting upon them, does
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59986:12"/>thence infer the mention'd Concluſion We paſs over the Premiſes ſo quickly that we perceive not whence the Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is drawn; only we find our ſelve<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſtrongly perſwaded of its Truth.</p>
               <p>Let us imagine that we underſtand the Language of the Cannibals, and that we preach to them this Maxim, receiv'd by almoſt all Nations, That to fatten Men in order to eat them, is a horrible thing Can we believe that they would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately agree to it? that they would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt their former Cuſtoms, and live ever afterwards as we do? 'Tis plain, that they would reſiſt the Truth we ſhould preach to them, as long a time as other Nations do all Sentiments contrary to their own. But what Reaſon can they pretend for this abominable manner of living? None at all, except what I have now mention'd. And 'tis ſo with all thoſe whoſe Paſſions will not permit 'em to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Errors: For neither the Atrocity of the Crime, nor the Groſſneſs of the Miſtake, will cauſe any Change in their Conduct.</p>
               <p>Were any body aſſur'd that his Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition was good and conformable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; that is, if he had clear and evident Proofs that he was what he really ought to be, and that he could not change into better; he might then juſtly conclude, That any Doctrine repugnant to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59986:12"/>muſt be falſe. Knowing, for Example, as we do, that it is a horrible thing to eat one another; if any not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhould perſwade us to eat a Man, we might reaſonably do all that the Horror of ſuch an Action could dictate to us. Before we follow therefore the Inclinations which Cuſtom begets in us, we ought to be fully convinc'd by clear and indubitable Reaſons, that ſuch a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is well grounded.</p>
               <p>And if the Unbelievers who reject the Chriſtian Religion becauſe it is contrary to their Paſſions, had good Reaſons to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe Paſſions lawful, we could not reproach them with their Infidelity. But if, on the contrary, we can ſhew that theſe Paſſions are blameable, and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Light of Reaſon, 'tis certain they ought to acknowledg themſelves in the wrong, and we might juſtly complain of their Obſtinacy.</p>
               <p>I don't know how theſe Maxims can be conteſted, ſeeing they are founded upon the Evidence of common Senſe. It may be ſaid, perhaps, that, without ſo many Preambles, I ſhould have come directly to the Point, and ſhew that Unbelievers refuſe Aſſent to the Goſpel from ill-grounded Prejudices. But I thought it neceſſary that the Principles whence I draw the following Conſequences, ſhould be ſeriouſly conſider'd.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59986:13"/>
               <p>As thoſe who reaſon from their preſent Diſpoſition, do it without thinking on't, I take it for granted, that the greateſt part of Unbelievers commit the ſame Fault; and I beg of them to retire, as it were, into themſelves, there to examine all the Principles by which they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd not to believe the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>Seeing the Morals of it are oppoſite to all the Vices that Reaſon condemns, it is impoſſible that any ſhould reject it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding himſelf engag'd in ſome of theſe Vices: For why ſhould any reject as falſe what is conformable to Reaſon, except it be that he's in a Diſpoſition contrary to this ſame Reaſon? Although 'tis not always perceiv'd, it follows not that the thing is otherwiſe. It merits therefore ſome Attention.</p>
               <p>The Morals of the Goſpel are reduc'd, according to the Expreſſion of one of Chriſt's Apoſtles, to live Temperately, Juſtly, and Piouſly. Temperance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all the Vertues which regard our Selves; Juſtice them that concern our Neighbour; and Piety thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to God. Our own Good requires us to live temperately, as the Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have demonſtrated: Now Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance conſiſts in a moderate Deſire of Honours, Riches, and Pleaſures. We ſhould not court Honours but by lawful
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59986:13"/>ways, not as a means to live great, but to be uſeful to the Society wherein we live. And this cannot be, except we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of duly diſcharging thoſe Offices which we ſeek, and of uſing thoſe Honours we are ambitious of, to good purpoſe. As for Riches, the Goſpel forbids us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire 'em as a Good; but if, without breach of any Chriſtian Vertue, we become rich, it commands us, not to deprive our ſelves of what is neceſſary, but to impart our Superfluities to the Needy. And as to Pleaſures, we may take none but ſuch as are not contrary to any Duty the Goſpel enjoins, and in ſuch a meaſure as will not engage us to violate any of its Laws. Thus the Goſpel will have us to ſacrifice all our Pleaſures to what it ordains us, and that we reſolve upon ſuffering all ſorts of Evils, rather than neglect one of its Commands. Theſe are the principal Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties very near, that regard our ſelves: for I deſign not to make here a complete Abridgment of the Chriſtian Morals: for my Subject does not require it; and it ſuffices that I bring to mind the chief Heads of them.</p>
               <p>The Juſtice which the Goſpel recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to us, does contain two things: One is, to render every one his Due; and this is what the Heathens themſelves call'd <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The other is, to do for our Neighbour all that we would wiſh him to

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59986:15"/>do for us were we in his Condition: that we ſhould pardon him, for Example, when he does us wrong, rather than to revenge it; and help him in all that we can, and that is no way contrary to the Precepts of the Goſpel. The Civil Laws may compel us, in part at leaſt, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every Man his Due, and they are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd for this purpoſe; but nothing can oblige us to do more, except the Deſire of living conformable to the Chriſtian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. The Heathens themſelves have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd, that to be good Men there was need of a great deal more than the Civil Laws requir'd. What a poor Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is it, ſays a Philoſopher, to be only good according to the Laws? How much larger is the Rule of the Duties we are oblig'd to, than that of the Law? How many things are requir'd by Piety, Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Juſtice, Liberality, and Fidelity, that are not expreſt in the publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords? <hi>Quam auguſta innocentia eſt ad legem bonum eſſe? Quanto latius patet officiorum, quam juris regula? Quam multa pietas, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitas, liberalitas, juſtitia, fides exigunt, quae omnia extra publicas tabulas ſunt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As it would be impoſſible to fulfil theſe Duties upon all ſorts of Occaſions, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when the Obſervation of them ſhould endanger Reputation, Goods, or Life, if there were no Reward to be expected in this Life nor after Death by ſuch as liv'd
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59986:15"/>according to the Goſpel; ſo God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to protect good Men here as far as ſhould be needful for them, and to render them eternally happy hereafter. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve theſe Promiſes, and to have that Gratitude for the Divinity which his Goodneſs requires of us, is what the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel calls Piety.</p>
               <p>This is an Abridgment of the Morals of Jeſus Chriſt, and which no body can reject, but becauſe he's not diſpos'd to live accordingly; as I'm going to ſhew by ſome Examples.</p>
               <p>When Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to preach the Goſpel, few Perſons of Quality, or that pretended to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Employments, embrac'd it, as we learn it from themſelves. At this day ſuch as doubt of the Truth of Chriſtianity, or are reſolv'd to believe it falſe, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Men of the ſame Rank. All that are acquainted with the World know ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, that the common People, and thoſe that have no aſpiring Thoughts, are more rarely troubl'd with Increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Doubts than Perſons of Quality, and thoſe who pretend to great Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or think themſelves worthy of ſuch.</p>
               <p>If we look for the Reaſons of this in the Perſons themſelves, we ſhall not find that the Ambitious do reaſon better than others, or diſcover Defects in Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59986:16"/>unknown to the reſt of the World. On the contrary, ſuch as think of nothing but advancing themſelves, do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtudy much in the Goſpel; and as they are ignorant of the Beauties of it, they could not be more capable than others to find out the Weakneſs of it if it had any. All the Knowledg they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs above the reſt of Men, is only the Art of ſo governing themſelves in the World as to come at their Ends.</p>
               <p>The true Reaſon why they doubt, or that throws them into Incredulity, is nothing elſe but their predominant Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Ambition, which is too oppoſite to the Morals of the Goſpel, to lodg in any Heart throughly perſwaded of its Truth, or touch'd by its Maxims. Let us ſuppoſe a Man very deſirous to poſſeſs a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Charge without having fit Talents for it; or if he has, that he deſigns not to ſerve his Country by his Place, but only to live ſplendidly and luxuriouſly: we may ſuppoſe farther, that he makes uſe of all Tricks to obtain it, and that he's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do any thing ſooner than miſs of it. This Paſſion which entirely takes him up, and fills his whole Imagination with the Pleaſure that accompanies all his Deſires, makes him look upon his own Conduct as the moſt reaſonable and the moſt innocent in the World. If a Man in this Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hears of the Goſpel (the firſt time we
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59986:16"/>may ſuppoſe) and be told what Chriſt ſaid of Ambition, can any wonder if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it, or is the Reaſon of it hard to be gueſs'd?</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, it were eaſy to ſhew that what the Goſpel teaches concerning Ambition is conformable to the cleareſt Evidence of good Senſe, and that many Pagan Philoſophers have taught it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. If the Diſpoſition therefore of an ambitious Man determines him to disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Goſpel, he muſt own at the ſame time, that he acts contrary to the cleareſt Light of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The ſame Reaſoning may be properly made concerning the avaritious, the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, the unjuſt, the vindicative Man, and all others that are engag'd in Habits oppoſite to the Goſpel. A certain <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueze</hi> call'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riel Acoſta,</hi> who turn'd Jew, and fell into Sadduciſm, could not digeſt that Precept of the Goſpel, <hi>viz. to love our Enemies;</hi> becauſe being naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful, and having been ill us'd by the Jews of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> he could never find in his Heart to forgive them. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded therefore, that the Practice of this Command being impoſſible, it was in vain to give it to Men, and could not believe that God had reveal'd it.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, that a Man extremely vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicative, and for many Years indulging himſelf in this Paſſion, cannot, without a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59986:17"/>Miracle, be brought of a ſudden to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, or patiently to ſuffer Injuries. In this Diſpoſition he's always ſure to reject the Goſpel, by reaſon of this one Precept, or at leaſt to refuſe Submiſſion to this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, ſuppoſing that the reſt are not too repugnant to his Inclinations. But if in thoſe Intervals wherein his Revenge is as it were ſuſpended a while, he comes to conſider the fatal Effects of this Paſſion, which would engage Men, if they always obey'd it, in perpetual Wars and Quarrels that could never terminate but in the Death of one or both the Perſons; he muſt acknowledg that Revenge is a moſt dangerous Paſſion, and that one or the other had better forgive his Enemy, or rather to pardon one another, ſo to put an end to their mutual Injuries. He will wiſh, it may be, that his Enemies would entertain the ſame Conſideration, and caſt off this Spirit of Vengeance, being ready to do as much on his ſide. The more this Thought comes into his Mind, the more reaſonable it will appear to him, and the more conformable to the true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Mankind. By little and little will the Deſire of ſeeing his Enemies cur'd of ſo great an Imperfection increaſe; and he will inſenſibly rid himſelf of it, to ſhew them a good Example. At length, inſtead of longing to revenge himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Enemies, inſtead of making Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59986:17"/>againſt them, he'll ardently wiſh they may become better Men, and will beg it of God in his Prayers. Nay, he'll on his ſide, as much as poſſible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards it, and after praying God, as he do's for himſelf, that his Enemies may become more vertuous, he'll wiſh 'em all that God is wont to beſtow and more, as much as he would deſire it for himſelf. Now, this it is <hi>to love our Enemies,</hi> for we cannot love them above our ſelves, and the Goſpel requires no more.</p>
               <p>It will be granted that theſe Thoughts are moſt reaſonable, and that it were to be wiſh'd all Mankind had the like Idea's. And as Men ſo diſpos'd would very eaſily comprehend the Poſſibility of loving our Enemies, they would be far from doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Truth of Chriſtianity upon the ſcore of this Precept.</p>
               <p>All that can be ſaid to this, is, that thoſe who reject the Religion of Chriſt, do it not upon the Account of its Morals, which are beyond Contradiction very good, and grounded upon the cleareſt Light of Reaſon; but becauſe it contains, in their Opinion, incredible Myſteries, and ſuppoſes Miracles that have no Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p>Two things we muſt remark then, that we may know whether the Difficulty they pretend of believing the Myſteries and Miracles of Religion, or whether the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59986:18"/>of its moral Precepts, is the true Cauſe of their Incredulity. The firſt is, if they don't believe many things as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible or perplex'd: And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, if the Maxims of their Morals be as reaſonable as thoſe of the Goſpel, or if they be not plainly oppoſite to it. If it happens that upon all other Accounts they readily believe things they do not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and that the Rules of their Conduct be more than the Goſpel admits, do they not give us juſt Occaſion to ſuſpect that their ill Habits are the ſecret, but true Cauſe of their Disbelief of the Goſpel, whatever they pretend?</p>
               <p>There is nothing ſo common as to ſee Unbelievers ſtrongly perſwaded of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary Aſtrology, and believing that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians can do ſeveral things beyond the Power and Order of Nature. Two great Miniſters of State, for example, whoſe Actions will not let us think that Religion was one of their greateſt Vertues, are both accus'd of believing the Predictions of Aſtrologers: and one of them of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading himſelf that a Man who vomited ſeveral ſorts of Liquors, did it by the Help of Magick. Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> ſays an Hiſtorian, conſulted, beſides Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, all kinds of Divination, even ſilly Women, whoſe Knowledg conſiſts in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours that make 'em foretel by chance ſome fortuitous Events. He was ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59986:18"/>as to attribute to the Operation of the Devil the Art of throwing out at the Mouth all ſorts of Liquors, after having firſt drunk Water, as was done by an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Mountebank. <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who was not yet a Cardinal, having at ſo ſimple a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe burſt out a laughing, had like to loſe his Favour by it: for the Cardinal being provok'd at this Mirth, whereby he thought <hi>Mazarin</hi> jeer'd him, ſaid ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally to him, that he was not Monſieur <hi>Mazarin</hi> who had a profound and exact Knowledg of every thing. <hi>Mazarin</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubmiſſively reply'd, that giving the fifty Piſtols which the Mountebank de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded for teaching his Secret, it might be ſeen whether the Devil had any hand in't. <hi>Mazarin</hi> himſelf look'd upon all Divinations as Fopperies, except Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, which he ſtrongly fancy'd, tho he feign'd the contrary. When Madam <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cini</hi> his Siſter dy'd, and afterwards the Dutcheſs of <hi>Mercaeur</hi> his Niece, according to the Prediction of an Aſtrologer, at <hi>Rome,</hi> given in Writing a great while before, he became extraordinary ſad and melancholy, not out of Tenderneſs to his Relations, but becauſe this ſame Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger had fix'd the Term of his own Death to a Time that was very near. He loſt his Appetite upon it, and ſlept not for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nights, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59986:19"/>
               <p>'Tis alſo known, that the Emperor <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> who could not believe the Prophecies of the Old and New Teſtament, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely addicted to the Auguries and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages drawn from the Intrals of Victims, and the Heathens themſelves have blam'd him for it.</p>
               <p>I take it for granted, that ſuch things as theſe are as hard to be credited, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in themſelves, as the Myſteries and Miracles of the Chriſtian Religion. But the Incredulous believe them at the ſame time that they refuſe their Aſſent to the Goſpel; becauſe theſe Opinions do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the manner of any Perſon's living, and are not at all incompatible, as the Chriſtian Morals are, with their ill Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits.</p>
               <p>Moreover, if the Unbelievers would ſtrictly examine themſelves, and compare their Conduct with that which the Goſpel preſcribes, I'll own my ſelf much deceiv'd if they find it Proof againſt the Rigour of its Precepts. <hi>Julian,</hi> of whom I was ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had many excellent Qualities which he needed not to quit by any means, had he remain'd ſtill a Chriſtian; and ſeveral bad ones he had likewiſe, which he muſt have rid himſelf of, would he follow the Morals of the Goſpel. At leaſt, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he could not be ſo injurious to the Chriſtians as he was, which appears by many of his Letters.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:59986:19"/>
               <p>From all this I conclude, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whatever can be ſaid, the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of a Perſon does exceedingly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to make him receive or reject Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; and that Unbelievers ought to examine themſelves hereupon, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this, whereof we accuſe them, be not true.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That Pride may be the Cauſe why Aſſent is not granted to the Proofs of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion.</head>
               <p>PRide is inconſiſtent with a ſtrong and lively perſwaſion that Chriſtianity is true; not only becauſe the Goſpel condemns it, as it does all other Paſſions contrary to the Good of Mankind, but alſo becauſe thoſe affected with it find themſelves diſpos'd by a particular Effect of this Vice to reject unexamin'd the Proofs alledg'd for the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. This is what I deſign to ſhew, after I have firſt deſcrib'd Pride and its contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vertue Humility, leſt what I am to ſay concerning it ſhould not be ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>
               <p>Pride is no other thing but a Diſpoſition of Mind that makes a Man imagine he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59986:20"/>more Knowledg, Endowments or Vertues than he truly does; and that by Conſequence he ſhould be more honour'd and eſteem'd than he deſerves. The Proud cannot without Vexation bear that the one or the other ſhould be deny'd to them, eſpecially if they are not refus'd to other Perſons. They have not only a high Idea of themſelves, but likewiſe deſpiſe others, who, they are eaſily perſwaded, have not the ſame good Qualities, nor any thing worthy of that Eſteem which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be their own due. The too good Opinion any conceives of himſelf, is ever accompany'd with a Contempt of others, and both the one and the other are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparent outwardly. Thoſe who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves to be blinded with this Paſſion, believe not only that there are no good Qualities except in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and in ſuch as admire them; but they alſo abhor all that to them appears ordinary, and think they ſhould debaſe themſelves, had they any Thoughts that were common to ſeveral others.</p>
               <p>Such were, for example, the antient Stoicks, who imagin'd they had more Knowledg than all the World beſides, and that they were above thoſe Weakneſſes remarkable in other Men. They look'd upon thoſe with Scorn and Pity (if their Principles would permit 'em to have any) who were not perſwaded of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59986:20"/>They troubl'd themſelves little with the Sentiments of others which they confider'd as idle Dreams, and never ſpoke of the moſt ordinary things but in ſtrange Terms. Pain was not an Evil, Pleaſure was not a Good, all Vertues were equal, there was no Difference between Vices; their Sage only had common Senſe, all others were Fools. They utter'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Paradoxes of this Nature, only to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh themſelves from the Vulgar, who have Ideas very oppoſite to theſe.</p>
               <p>On the contrary <hi>Humility,</hi> which is the ſame Vertue the Heathens call'd <hi>Modeſty,</hi> conſiſts in having no other Sentiments of our ſelves but what are proportion'd to our good Qualities, and not to pretend to Honours that are not due to us. Nay, this Vertue goes yet further, and thoſe whom we may call humble patiently ſuffer themſelves to be debas'd much below their Merit. As thoſe who have this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue eſteem not themſelves more than they ought, ſo they are far from deſpiſing others, and willing to do them all the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice they can reaſonably wiſh. Nor are they vex'd to ſee People that are their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours in many reſpects exalted above them, and more conſider'd than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p>This Vertue may be remarkably ſeen in the Primitive Chriſtians, who perfectly knowing the Errors of the Heathens, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59986:21"/>the Defects of their Philoſophy, did not reject however all that it taught, to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the Pagan Philoſophers. On the contrary, they rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily approv'd all that was good in it, and were tranſported to diſcover a Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between the Notions of thoſe Sages ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd by the Multitude, and the Doctrines of the Goſpel. They even confeſs'd with great Sincerity, that the Heathen Authors did much ſurpaſs in Eloquence the firſt Writers of the Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus</hi> in his <hi>Stromates,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Evangelick Preparation,</hi> can furniſh a thouſand Proofs of it; as well as many other Eccleſiaſtical Authors whom I need not cite.</p>
               <p>Such therefore as reject Sentiments ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receiv'd, or at leaſt receiv'd by a great Number of Perſons, ſhould take care that the Love of Singularity, rather than a Demonſtration that others are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken, has made them quit the beaten Road. 'Tis true indeed that the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thoſe who embrace a certain Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is not a good Proof of the Truth of it; but on the other hand it is no cogent Argument that a thing is falſe, becauſe many People believe it.</p>
               <p>It is certain notwithſtanding, that to be diſtinguiſh'd from the Croud, a Man fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently rejects what he believes true, for no other Reaſon, but becauſe it is a vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59986:21"/>Notion. A vain Spirit cannot bear that he ſhould be equall'd in any thing to an infinite number of Perſons whoſe Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg he believes inferiour to his own, and whoſe mean Inclinations aim at nothing but what is common.</p>
               <p>I'm perſwaded that ſeveral are Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, becauſe at leaſt the fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity are extremely common. They think it noble to be indeceiv'd concerning vulgar Opinions, and to look upon others as People that feed themſelves upon Chimera's. A Man thus conceited of himſelf, thinks he's ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated far above the credulous Multitude, which is led rather by Cuſtom, than gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Reaſon. <q rend="margQuotes">There is nothing ſo pleaſant, ſays an Epicurean Poet, as to live in the exalted Temple of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where you may enjoy a perpetual Calm, and whence you may look down upon other Men wandring and ſcatter'd in their different ways of living.</q>

               <p>But at bottom, one expoſes himſelf, as I have ſaid already, as much to Decepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by contemning whatever the Vulgar eſteems, for no other Reaſon than this;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59986:22"/>as by blindly embracing all that the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude authorizes. Neither its Aprroba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nor its Hatred are the proper marks of Truth or Falſhood. If there have been Chimera's generally receiv'd, there have been alſo as many ridiculous Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons countenanc'd by a ſmall number of People who imagin'd themſelves more knowing than others. Therefore when any finds himſelf inclin'd to forſake vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Sentiments, he ought to take heed that he be not impos'd upon by the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Thoughts of being exempted from thoſe Errors wherein he ſees others en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd. This may be as well the Deluſion of a ſecret Pride, as the Effect of uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Knowledg.</p>
               <p>It is by ſo much the more dangerous to fall out of Vanity into any ſingular Thoughts, as that when once a Man is govern'd by this Principle, it is the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thing in the World to make him change his Mind. The ſame Paſſion that leads him into it, confirms him in it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly, by reaſon of the Pleaſure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it fills thoſe who will be blinded by it, repreſenting them, as I ſaid, to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Perſons highly elevated above the Vulgar. Beſide all this, vain People imagining they are more clear-ſighted than others, eaſily believe themſelves ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver miſtaken, and that the reſt of Men have not the neceſſary Sagacity for diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Truth.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:59986:22"/>
               <p>This is the reaſon that when any, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have not ſo good an Opinion as of themſelves, propoſes to them Sentiments contrary to their own, they will not ſo much as give him the Hearing. The firſt Thought that offers it ſelf then to their Minds, or, if you pleaſe, the Sentiment that is awak'd in their Heart, is, that if this Man ſpoke the Truth, it would follow that a Perſon whom they deſpiſe, and not, as they think, without Reaſon, ſhould have more Penetration and a ſounder Judgment than themſelves. But this is what they can never agree to; for ſo they muſt entirely change the pleaſing Idea they hitherto entertain'd of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others. They would be oblig'd to allow thoſe whom they always believ'd much their Inferiours, a more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rank in their Eſteem than themſelves, and, in certain Regards, acknowledg their Superiority.</p>
               <p>I ſhall illuſtrate this Truth by ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. Let's take a Jewiſh Doctor, and, if you will, of the Sacerdotal Race. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him to have ſtudied the Laws of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> with great Application, and the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions currant among the Jews in the Apoſtles time. Add likewiſe, that he ſucceeded well enough in this Study, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Notion Men had of it then; that he thereby acquir'd a great Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59986:23"/>amongſt the moſt conſiderable of his Nation; and had been preferr'd to the greateſt Honours they could confer upon him. A Man in theſe Circumſtances might very eaſily conceive a good Opinion of his own Perſon and Underſtanding, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently deſpiſe ſuch as were deſtitute of thoſe things which procur'd him all that Honour and Eſteem.</p>
               <p>Now let us ſuppoſe, that one of the common People, not of the Prieſtly Stock, neither skill'd in the Law, nor of any Eſteem in the World, goes to ſee this eminent Prieſt, and tells him of things directly contrary to his Sentiments; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains againſt him, for inſtance, That the beſt part of the Traditions he had learn'd were contrary to the true Senſe of the Law, and that a Man may be acceptable to God without obſerving any of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaick Ceremonies. Now what would the Prieſt, think you, anſwer to this? What Opinion would he have of a Perſon that ſhould ſpeak after this manner? 'Tis no difficult Buſineſs to gueſs, that he would treat this Man with Indignation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; a little of his Pity is the moſt he could expect. It is plain notwithſtanding, that the Prieſt would be more deſerving of this Treatment, whatever good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had of himſelf.</p>
               <p>To ſet the Effects of Pride in another Light, let us imagine an Epicurean Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59986:23"/>a Man of Parts, and that by his Writings and Diſcourſes had got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a conſiderable Reputation amongſt the Greeks, ſuch as <hi>Lucian</hi> was for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or any other that you pleaſe. This Man was accuſtom'd for a great while to laugh at the Heathen Religion, wherein, doubtleſs, he was not to blame; but he alſo join'd to it all other Religions, without examining them. He looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Religion in general as mere Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or as a Trick of Politicians to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Simple. He has a hundred times declaim'd among his Friends againſt the Infatuation and Prejudices of Mankind in this reſpect; nor did he miſs the Return of Applauſe from thoſe of the ſame Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. His Friend's and his own Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries againſt Religion have been a long time the beſt ſeaſoning of their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and Debauches.</p>
               <p>Let us alſo ſend this Philoſopher to ſome vulgar Perſon, who undertakes to prove againſt him, that his Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm is the moſt abſurd thing in the World; and endeavours to inſpire him with ſome Awe of a Divinity, whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence governs the Univerſe. I deſire not that this ſhould be granted me as true or probable, but let us ſuppoſe it ſo a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute or two. Now, What will the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean ſay? He'll preſently put on a jeering Countenance, and laugh at all this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59986:24"/>Man has ſaid to him, without examining any part of it. And indeed, What Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability is there that a Perſon of Wit ſhould condeſcend to learn of one who ſeems to have none, and who is infatuated to boot with the Opinions of the Mob?</p>
               <p>Theſe Examples belong properly to the Ages paſt; and to be ſenſible of their Force, we muſt, as it were, forget our own Time, and imagine our ſelves living before we had yet a Being. But ſuch as have any Knowledg of Antiquity and the preſent Time, and have compar'd our Paſſions with thoſe of our Predeceſſors, know that the Theatre of the World has only chang'd its Ornaments, and that the Heart of Man is the ſame now as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Men are proud, as they have always been; and it muſt be granted, that this Paſſion may work the ſame Effect now, as it could have upon a Jewiſh Prieſt or Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curean Philoſopher ſixteen hundred Years ago. We ſee every day, that a Man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd in favour of an Opinion, defends it out of Vanity, againſt the cleareſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Reaſon. A Profeſſor, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that in the Univerſity has long taught the old Philoſophy or the old Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, not only rejects the moſt ingenious and probable Conjectures of the Moderns, but even thoſe Demonſtrations which ſhew us the Errors of the Antients as plain as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59986:24"/>the Sun. The Reaſon of this Conduct is no other, but that if he acknowledg'd what the Moderns ſay to be true, he muſt at the ſame time own that he taught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for many Years but pure Chimera's: nor can he find in his heart to humble himſelf ſo much to others, who have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd Truths whereof he's ignorant.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who doubt of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or that reject it, ought to retire within themſelves, and conſider why they yield not to its Reaſons. They will find perhaps, that the imaginary Pleaſure of being above the common Level, and their Unwillingneſs to be in the ſame Rank with ſuch as they deſpiſe, are the true Cauſes which retain them in their Doubts and Infidelity; or at leaſt, that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition contributes towards it very much.</p>
               <p>As it cannot be deny'd that Pride is a Vice, and Modeſty a Vertue, it muſt be granted, that ſuch as act by a Principle of Pride do put themſelves in danger, at leaſt of being deceiv'd; and that therefore Pride ſhould never be concern'd in the Search of Truth.</p>
               <p>This every body will own; but I may be ask'd, How we ſhall know that a Man judges by a Principle of Vanity, and by what means we can defend our ſelves from the Deluſions of Pride? for thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the common Opinions, will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that they do it out of Vanity.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59986:25"/>To this I anſwer, that beſides a Man's own Conſciouſneſs, we may know by two things whether the Motive of Pride comes into our Judgments of things.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that when we judg after that manner, we never carefully examine the Matter in queſtion. We content our ſelves with a very general and ſuperficial Review; after which we peremptorily conclude, without ever beginning our Examen anew. 'Tis to no purpoſe for thoſe who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to beg a little patient Hearing, or to have their Reaſons exactly conſider'd once more; for they ſhall no longer be liſten'd to. They are condemn'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Appeal, and can never recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So a Judgment once made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Examination, ſerves for a Principle to others, who continue to condemn on what they never well thought of, and will not grant any Hearing to their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>If any doubts of what I ſay, let thoſe who out of Pride have raſhly decided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth they did not underſtand, endeavour exactly to repeat the Reaſons of them they have condemn'd. Had they judg'd after a mature Examen, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a long and ſtrict Diſcuſſion of all that was alledg'd in Defence of what they condemn'd, they would ſo well underſtand it, as never to forget it. They could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat, and ſhew the Weakneſs of each Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59986:25"/>brought againſt them: As we ſee a Judg, that has carefully read and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd all the Parts and Papers of a Trial, report the Particulars without any Heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; eſpecially when it is a Matter of Conſequence, and deſerving Attention.</p>
               <p>But I take it for granted, that thoſe who reject the Truth of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, cannot diſtinctly report the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch as defend it, nor tell what they except againſt in every one of them. This is what they ſhould examine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about, and without which, they muſt confeſs they did pronounce a haſty Sentence: nor can they, without Injuſtice, refuſe to examine once again a Matter of ſo great Importance.</p>
               <p>All the Books that have been ſeen, and all the Diſcourſes we could hear upon this Subject, contain only ſome looſe Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which ſeem by no means to be the Reſult of an exact and methodical Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Theſe Difficulties cannot be more ſufficient to inform thoſe who would judg ſolidly of ſo great an Affair, than the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of one of the Parties are to inform equitable Judges.</p>
               <p>We have therefore Reaſon to believe, that thoſe who declare themſelves againſt the Chriſtian Religion, after reſolving out of Vanity againſt the common Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, continue to reject them by the ſame Principle. I confeſs they may have,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59986:26"/>and that they actually have, other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; for it is very rare, that in a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is made of a Subject ſo full as the Chriſtian Religion with all its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, there ſhould not enter Motives of divers ſorts. But I maintain, that the particular one of Pride, I have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, is found among the reſt. I won't ſay here, that the other Motives, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be, are not better than this. I ſhall prove it in the Sequel of this Work: for 'tis enough now to ſhew that Vanity is concern'd in't.</p>
               <p>Another thing whereby it may be known what great Influence Pride had upon a Judgment made of any Subject, is, that after having embrac'd an Opinion that cannot be demonſtrated, 'tis preſum'd that this Opinion unexamin'd muſt ſerve as an infallible Rule to judg of Truth and Falſhood. Mathematicians have their Axioms, their Definitions, and their Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which they do not demonſtrate, by reaſon of their own great Clearneſs and Plainneſs, which puts 'em beyond the Reach of all ſorts of Doubts. They have Reaſon to ſuppoſe them therefore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proving them; but to ſuppoſe moſt obſcure and uncertain, not to ſay falſe things, and to make uſe of thoſe Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as Principles, is abſurd. To expect this Method ſhould be approved of, and to treat ſcornfully thoſe who reject it, is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59986:26"/>ſo ſenſible a Mark of their being govern'd by Vanity, that I do not know a greater Proof can be given of it.</p>
               <p>The Jews, for Example, when the Goſpel begun to appear in the World, thought they had a Right to ſuppoſe as indiſputable the eternal Duration of the Moſaick Law, and the Neceſſity of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it in order to become acceptable to God; that to demand a Proof of it was ſufficient to gain their Hatred. The Greek Philoſophers likewiſe of that time, look'd upon themſelves as ſo knowing, and upon their Opinions as ſo well eſtabliſh'd, that every thing was falſe, in their Judgment, which contradicted them the leaſt in the World. Nevertheleſs it may be ſaid, that the particular Principles of the Jews and Heathen Philoſophers, compar'd to Chriſtianity, were not even probable; as I could ſhew, if thoſe I have to do with doubted of it. So the Jews, thoſe <hi>blind Guides of the Blind,</hi> and the Greeks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited of a thouſand Chimera's, concluded the Goſpel to be falſe out of mere Vanity.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who, being educated among Chriſtians, are got into the ſame Fancy, ſhould take heed they do not commit the like Fault, unleſs they will be voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceiv'd. Let them examine then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the Judgment they form of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, they ſuppoſe nothing but what is clear and inconteſtable. They reproach
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59986:27"/>Chriſtians with making Suppoſitions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Proofs; let them not be guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelves of what they object to others.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I'm perſwaded that if they go back to the firſt Principles of their Reaſonings, and then reduce them to certain Propoſitions, they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of their having built upon the moſt obſcure and incomprehenſible Principles that ever were. To ſuppoſe, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that <hi>there is but one Subſtance in the World, compounded of Extenſion and Thought, and which modifies it ſelf, as we ſee the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is, without having any ſupreme Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence diſtinct from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe it ſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about it:</hi> To ſuppoſe, I ſay, ſo ſtrange a Propoſition without demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating it, is certainly to imagine that the peremptory manner of ſaying ſuch obſcure things ſerves them for Evidence or Demonſtration. When I ſay <hi>to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> I underſtand, as Mathematicians do, what leaves no Doubt nor Difficulty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind in the Minds of any who underſtand the Terms of the Demonſtration. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they muſt not talk of demonſtrating, unleſs they would impoſe upon the Weak by this Word. Let the Writings of thoſe be read over and over who maintain the Propoſition I have mention'd, and ground themſelves upon it, to deny the Truth of Chriſtianity, and it will appear that there
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59986:27"/>is nothing in all Religion which equals the obſcuring of this Principle. There are notwithſtanding ſome People, who utter it as an inconteſtable Truth, and judg thereby of whatever the Chriſtians ſay concerning God, the Creation of the World, and Providence. If theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would diligently examine themſelves, I'm much deceiv'd if they did not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that one of the greateſt Reaſons which brings them to think this a clear Principle, is, their valuing themſelves upon defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Opinion remote from vulgar Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of admitting rather the moſt obſcure things imaginable, than they ſhould mix again with the Croud, from which they endeavour'd hereby to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh themſelves. As Credulity and Superſtition add to their Objects, as it were, a falſe Light, which ſerves them inſtead of Evidence: So Pride makes a Geometrical Principle of a thing that's in it ſelf unintelligible.</p>
               <p>There are other Perſons to whom this dogmatical and peremptory Air is ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, that they equally condemn ſuch as ſtick to the vulgar Opinions, and thoſe who, forſaking what is commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, endeavour to eſtabliſh new Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. They think that ſeeing there are Difficulties every where, and thoſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inſurmountable, the ſureſt way is to affirm nothing, and to reject all without
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59986:28"/>eſtabliſhing any thing. I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to confute this Principle here; I ſhall only ſay, that altho this Way ſeems very different from that whereof we have been ſpeaking, it is probable nevertheleſs that it proceeds from the like Diſpoſition of Mind. It is not much leſs agreeable to humane Pride to conſider it ſelf ſecur'd from popular Errors by doubting of every thing, than by eſtabliſhing Principles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe that are commonly receiv'd. Some look upon other Men as the Sport of their Opinions, and the Prey, to ſpeak ſo, of a thouſand Chimeras; whilſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Shelter of Doubt, they think themſelves ſafe from the Danger of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>It might be ſaid nevertheleſs by ſome Men, that not Pride, but the mere Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility of diſcovering the Truth, which is a very mortifying thing, is the Cauſe of their Doubts. I won't ſay that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear not over-mortify'd who are in this Condition, nor will I ſet about to ſhew the Abſurdity of Scepticiſm; I ſhall only remark, that no body ſtops at a mere Doubt in Religion. Thoſe who ſay they have Doubts, are not content to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others as poſſibly deceiv'd, but as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſo. They conſider not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as Perſons who might well be in an Error, but as having found the true Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of Infallibility; and this may be the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59986:28"/>Effect of humane Pride, as much as the boldeſt Determinations. Let them have a great Care therefore; and ſince it is manifeſt, that to doubt as well as to affirm out of Vanity, is expoſing of ones ſelf to Error, let them get rid of this fallacious Paſſion; or, at leaſt, ſuſpend the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it whilſt they judg of Religion.</p>
               <p>We require not this of them from the Principles of that Religion whereof they doubt, or which they reject, but from this Maxim of common Senſe, <hi>viz. That a Paſſion, ſuch as Pride is, cannot be of any Service in the Diſcovery of the Truth.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> That what keeps <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers from yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Proofs of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, partly conſiſts perhaps in mere Prejudices, which all the while may be falſe.</head>
               <p>WERE I writing againſt the Pagans, Jews, or Mahometans, and ſhould ſay that their Prejudices kept them wedded to the Religions whereof they made Profeſſion; then all the World, as well thoſe who believe as thoſe that disbelieve Chriſtianity, would conclude me in the right. But as I write againſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59986:29"/>Men that have been educated in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and that are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of its Truth, it may be ask'd what it is I underſtand here by Prejudices, when I ſay that they are the Cauſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, why Unbelievers yield not their Aſſent to it. They were brought up, as I ſaid, in Chriſtianity, which, one would think, ſhould prejudice them in favour of this Religion. But there are two ſorts of Prejudices; the firſt are the Effects of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſuch as are thoſe of the Jews, of the Heathens, and of the Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, againſt Chriſtianity. The ſecond proceed from a particular Depravation of the Mind and Underſtanding of ſome, and whereof it is ſomewhat difficult to render a Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Theſe People do eaſily conquer ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Prejudices of their Education; but after ſlightly forming to themſelves other Notions without examining them as they ſhould, they afterwards become Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices to them all the reſt of their Lives: and 'tis of theſe Prejudices I deſign to treat upon this occaſion. I ſhall not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how they are form'd, becauſe they owe their Original to ſuch a Complication of ſeveral Motives, and to Circumſtances ſo different, that it is not poſſible, it may be, to diſtinguiſh them rightly. 'Tis enough that they be true Prejudices; that is to ſay, haſty Concluſions, which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59986:29"/>ſerve 'em afterwards inſtead of a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe, for example, that a Man born in any part of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> where very groſs Errors, as it happens but too often, are mix'd with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles; let us ſuppoſe, I ſay, that this Man comes to diſcern theſe Errors by reading the Books of thoſe Divines who are of the contrary Party: He's preſently cur'd of the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of his Education; for he was always told that the Sentiments maintain'd in the Place of his Nativity were true. It may notwithſtanding fall out that a Perſon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſcovering theſe Errors, cannot go back to the very Spring, and examine the Chriſtian Religion in it ſelf, ſuch as it is in the Writings of the Apoſtles. There he ſtops then, and imagines not only that the Religion of his Country is falſe, but he makes the ſame Concluſion concerning all Religions, without excepting that of the firſt Followers of Chriſt. He may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch Thoughts a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can find any body to whom he dares open his Mind, or that is able to undeceive him if he does: and theſe Thoughts may take ſuch deep Rooting at length, that it ſhall not be an eaſy Matter afterwards to eradicate them. If the Man too be any thing ſpeculative, he may in this Condition form other Principles, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59986:30"/>on which he ſhall reaſon all his Life, tho they be in themſelves moſt falſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the Prejudices from which, I ſaid, we muſt preſerve our ſelves, and that may contribute much to get the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion rejected. All thoſe who are tainted with them, are not equally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of expreſſing them clearly; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, they dare not always declare them freely to thoſe with whom they diſcourſe upon the Subject; ſo that it is a moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Buſineſs to examine them in ſuch: manner as may turn to their Advantage.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, it may be ſaid in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of all Judgments made of a thing from Principles which are not certain that if Men ſhould thus hit upon the Truth, it muſt be by pure Chance, and conſequently not to be rely'd upon. <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> all ſorts of Truth, how much more is it to be regarded in a Truth of ſo great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance as Religion is granted by all to be?</p>
               <p>This Rule then is grounded upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, and no body can diſagree to it. Now let us apply it to a Prejudice very common amongſt thoſe who doubt of the Truth of Chriſtianity, or that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject it. They cannot, they ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Miracles upon which it is built becauſe they never ſaw any Miracles, nor ever ſpoke to any Perſons worthy of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59986:30"/>who aſſur'd 'em that he had ſeen the like. They cannot any better imagine that this Earth whereupon we live had a Beginning, or that ever there was a time when there were neither Animals nor Plants. The Reaſon of this is, becauſe they have always remark'd in a manner the ſame ſtate of things, and have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpoke to any that had ſeen this Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>I maintain in the firſt place, that this is a mere Prejudice, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to this general Maxim; <hi>A Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not believe that whereof he has never ſeen any Examples, nor ſpoke to any Eye-witneſſes worthy of Credit who could give a Relation of it.</hi> We ſhall find that this is very far from a Geometrical Axiom, if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Grounds of it. What has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded ſome People to a Belief of this Principle, is, That many times they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd Falſhoods by its means. Some antient Philoſophers, for Example, have confuted the Fables of the Poets concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Centaurs, the Giants, the Monſter Chimera, and the like fictitious things, by this very Maxim, <hi>What has been, now is;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Palephat. de reb. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credibil.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſhall be for the future;</hi> I agree that this Axiom may be of uſe, when ſuch as affirm unheard-of things deſerve no Credit, as were the Poets, who own'd they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented a great part of what they ſaid. But I deny that it extends generally to all
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59986:31"/>things, or that it can paſs for a ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Maxim.</p>
               <p>When a poſſible thing is atteſted by People in whom we ſee no appearance of Diſhoneſty or Fraud, this Maxim is of no uſe, altho we never ſaw any thing like that which we are told of, nor ever heard others ſpeak of it. Thoſe who firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd <hi>America,</hi> and ſpoke of the Plants or Animals they had found there, and which are Strangers to our Continent, were worthy of Credit, and deſerv'd to be believ'd, though we had never heard of the like before; nay though none had gone after them to <hi>America,</hi> and that we had not read their Voyages till a long time after their Deceaſe. It is manifeſt, that ſuch as ſhould count their Relations fabulous from this Principle, would fall themſelves into a very great Error, as Time has ſhewn. The ſame may be ſaid of what was declar'd by the firſt who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd they had been with our Antipodes. What they ſaid was not the leſs true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe till then it was not heard of; and had the Art of Navigation decay'd ſo much after their Return, that none had ſince undertaken the ſame Voyage, ſuch as ſhould now read their Travels could have no ſufficient Reaſons to disbelieve what they ſaid.</p>
               <p>It is plain by theſe Examples, that this Maxim cannot paſs for a Mathematical
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59986:31"/>Axiom, that admits of no Exception; and that conſequently nothing can be merely concluded from it without the Addition of other Proofs. If it be conſider'd in it ſelf, this will not be the more call'd in queſtion, ſeeing there is no body ſuch a Fool as to make his preſent Knowledg the Meaſure or Rule of True and Falſe in all Matters. Who can, without Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, flatter himſelf to have ſo extenſive a Knowledg of all poſſible things, as to pronounce that certainly falſe which is not contain'd in his own Stock of Knowledg? But it is not neceſſary to be more large in the Confutation of ſo ſtrange an Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the Incredulous ſuppoſe this, without perceiving it, as a Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical Principle; and from it conclude that what is ſaid, for Inſtance, of the Creation of the World, and of Miracles, is not true. Let them ſeriouſly conſider the Point, and they'll find that from a Prejudice ſo little reaſonable they draw Conſequences which they think clear as the Day. The good Opinion they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of themſelves and their Knowledg, join'd to Experience, which upon ſome occaſions does confirm this Maxim, makes them ſhut their Eyes upon this account, as I ſaid, without perceiving it.</p>
               <p>I ſhall bring another Example of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice not better eſtabliſh'd than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59986:32"/>and whereupon is grounded, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, a great part of the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Unbelievers. Some who have Senſe enough to quit the Opinions of their Youth which they drew from their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without knowing why, have not always Penetration and Exactneſs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment enough to ſubſtitute any thing better in their room: Yet they cannot forbear ſearching out other Principles; for none can abſolutely ſtop there, as I could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, were this the proper place of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p>As they are not ſatisfy'd with what they learn'd concerning God and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo they form to themſelves new Ideas of them, which are little better than their former ones; but they pleaſe them more, becauſe they are the Fruits of their own Meditation, which never fail of delighting the Underſtanding that is their Parent. They imagine, for Example, That if there were a God, who had created Men, who would do 'em Good, and in order to it had reveal'd himſelf to them, he ought to have done it in this manner. Firſt, He ſhould (according to them) have made himſelf known to all Mankind, to render them equally happy, ſeeing he is their common Father. Secondly, This Revelation ſhould have begun from the Creation of the firſt Man, and ſo be continu'd throughout all the World, according as it was planted
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59986:32"/>with Men; ſeeing it is not leſs neceſſary to ſuch as are born now, than to thoſe of the Ages paſt. Thirdly, It ſhould have been at the Beginning ſo clear, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with Circumſtances ſo convincing, that none could doubt of the Senſe or Truth of the Revelation; and the Proofs of it ought to have ſtill ſubſiſted, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one might examine them, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon the Relation of another; otherwiſe, if there be any Revelation, it is uſeleſs, ſay they, as Experience ſhews. In the fourth place, This Law ſhould have been proportionated to the preſent State of Mankind, that ſo it might be obey'd; or elſe the Creator of Men ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Nature, to the end it ſhould not oppoſe it ſelf to the Obſervation of his Laws; without which, they ſignify almoſt nothing, and are unworthy a Wiſdom that knows the Condition of them to whom it preſcribes them; or of a bountiful Being who preſcribes them to Men, to render them more happy.</p>
               <p>Theſe Principles appear ſpecious at firſt ſight, becauſe they ſeem to be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the high Idea we ought to have of the Divinity. And as the Incredulous think they ſee the quite contrary in what the Chriſtians ſay of Revelation, they hence conclude, that the Chriſtians are in an Error; and they imagine to prove it the better againſt them, in as much as they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59986:33"/>build upon the ſame Suppoſitions with them concerning the Nature of God.</p>
               <p>But I'm going to ſhew, that this way of reaſoning is grounded upon a Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, which is manifeſtly falſe: for to come at the Propoſitions we now read, they muſt proceed by theſe Steps.
<list>
                     <item>1. By reaſoning we may exactly know what ſhould be the Carriage of God towards Men, if there be a God, ſuch as he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</item>
                     <item>2. We do in effect form an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and complete Idea of God, which is contain'd in the Propoſitions we have been reading.</item>
                     <item>3. And if the ſuppos'd Carriage of the Creator is not conformable to it, then there is no ſuch thing, and all that is ſaid of it is falſe.</item>
                     <item>4. We ſee, by the Hiſtory of times paſt, and by what we know of the preſent State of Mankind, that the very contrary has always hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to this day.</item>
                     <item>5. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the Propoſitions which thoſe, I mention'd before, ſuppoſe; as all, who have any Idea of the right Method of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning muſt grant. But the firſt of theſe Propoſitions is certainly falſe: for it is manifeſt that Revelation is not clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough concerning the Deſigns of God with reſpect to Mankind in general, as that we might thence form an exact or complete Idea of his Carriage towards Men. And it is a thing not material for us to know; no body being oblig'd to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59986:33"/>learn more than he ought to believe and do, in order to become acceptable to God, without troubling himſelf about the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of his Providence with relation to Mankind in general, nor yet about his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Deſigns. To be a good Subject to a Prince, it is no ways needful to penetrate into all the Secrets of his Politicks and Deſigns; it is ſufficient to know what the Laws of the State command him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. This is what <hi>Moſes</hi> taught the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when he ſaid to them, that <hi>ſecret things belong'd to the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> 
                  <hi>but the things reveal'd to them and to their Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt Propoſition being falſe, the ſecond, which is a Conſequence of it, cannot hold; and no Perſon, without an extravagant Preſumption, can ſay that he has a perfect Idea of the Method whereby God ought to govern the World, if he would act conformable to the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that are attributed to him. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, although we have ſome Idea of theſe Attributes, it follows not that we conceive them in their whole Extent, or that we can exactly know what Carriage is moſt agreeable to them. We know, for Example, that God is moſt wiſe; that is to ſay, that this Sovereign Intelligence never acts, without propoſing certain Ends worthy of himſelf, and that he goes to thoſe Ends by the Ways he judges to be moſt proper, and that are effectually
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59986:34"/>ſo. But for all this, we know not, at leaſt in a diſtinct manner, every End which he has propos'd to himſelf, nor all the Ways whereby he deſigns to come at them. No body could ever boaſt of gathering this from either Revelation, or the Events that happen in the World. We know by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, that ſome Princes have govern'd their Subjects with great Wiſdom; but who can value himſelf upon knowing all their particular Deſigns, and the Methods they have us'd to come at their Ends, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from their Writings or their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct? It muſt be confeſt then, that we may know ſomething of the Attributes of God, without being able to penetrate into all the Secrets of his Conduct; and common Senſe does teach us, that we ought not to judg raſhly thereof.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, the third Propoſition cannot be look'd upon, but as the moſt preſumptuous and temerarious Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that could poſſibly be. It would be abſurd to reaſon thus concerning an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly King, and boldly to affirm that he was guilty of ill Management becauſe he had not follow'd our Idea of the Conduct he ſhould obſerve, without our having an exact Knowledg of the State of his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, nor of his Deſigns. And it is a thouſand times more abſurd ſo to judg of the Divine Underſtanding, infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above ours; for we muſt remember,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59986:34"/>that Unbelievers reaſon upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Principles of Revelation.</p>
               <p>To come to the fourth Propoſition, we cannot exactly judg of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards Mankind during the Ages paſt, by the Hiſtories we have. Few of 'em are extant: but if we had all the Hiſtories that ever were written, yet that would not be enough to form ſuch a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by. The exacteſt Hiſtories do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily omit a world of things, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late only the moſt conſiderable Events which regard States, rather than the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Nations, or the Revelations they might receive from Heaven.</p>
               <p>It muſt be granted then, that none can, without extreme Raſhneſs, take upon them to be Judges of Divine Providence; or to conclude that there is no God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he governs not the World after that manner they think he ſhould. This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer might ſuffice to ſhew the Falſity of thoſe Prejudices which the Incredulous form againſt Revelation and Providence, and which I have ſet down in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>However, to ſhew fully the Danger of being impos'd upon by Prejudices of this nature, I ſhall examine them as they are in themſelves, though I have already de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd their Foundation. I might, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado, ſay concerning the firſt Propoſition, That God had ſufficiently
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59986:35"/>made himſelf known to all Men, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing his Will to the firſt Patriarch from whom they are deſcended, to <hi>Noah,</hi> for Example, and to his Children; and it is very probable, that the general Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of a God, and the Service due to him has its Origin hence rather than from the Reaſonings of any People. I might add likewiſe, That God having created Men free, and contenting himſelf with giving them Laws, they have abus'd their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by violating his Commands, and ſo became unworthy that God ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to make himſelf known to them, as perhaps he might have done, if they had made a better Uſe of the Favours he was pleas'd to heap upon them.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall only ſay, That he might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, without any way blemiſhing his Goodneſs, beſtow more Favours upon ſome People than others. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo free as the Effects of Beneficence which are not due; and no body can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably complain that he has not receiv'd from ſuch a Benefactor what he had given to others. On the contrary, he ought to be thankful that he gave him what he has, and which was no more due to him than what he has not. As there is a great Diverſity amongſt Creatures of ſeveral Kinds, ſome having more and ſome leſs Properties than others; and that all the while no Perſon maintains that God ought
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59986:35"/>to have made all equally perfect, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting any Difference between his Works: why might not God alſo be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to place ſome Variety in the ſame Species of Beings? Since we ſee that the Diſpoſition of Humane Bodies does vary in a world of things, that their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are not more of a piece, and ſince it is not thought ſtrange that God has thus differently diſtributed his Gifts; why ſhould it be accounted a wonderful thing that God has imparted more or leſs Light to the ſeveral Nations which compoſe Mankind? The greateſt Difficulty in this matter, if I'm not miſtaken, proceeds from this, that People, without percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, confound God's Juſtice with his Beneficence; and withal they unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuppoſe, that God requires an equal Return of Vertue from all Men, and that he will judg them all by the ſame Law. Upon this Suppoſition, it ſeems repugnant to the Attributes of God to expect as much from the <hi>Cafers</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi> or the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of <hi>America,</hi> as from more knowing People; and it is thought unjuſt that God ſhould diſpenſe his Gifts ſo diverſly, ſince he would judg all Men upon the ſame Foot.</p>
               <p>But tho the Beneficence of God be, according to Revelation, perfectly free, inſomuch that no Nation can complain that another is preferr'd to it;<note place="margin">Rom. 9.10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

                     </gap> judg'd by the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the ſecond Queſtion touching the continuance of Revelation, all the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is taken away by what is now ſaid God will have all reaſonable Regard to every Circumſtance of thoſe People to whom he has ſo differently diſtributed his Favours. Revelation does teach us the contrary no where; and if any Chriſtian Doctors have added to the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, it is incumbent upon them to defend their own Opinions, and not upon thoſe who deſign only to defend the Chriſtian Religion. None can, without Injuſtice, impute to its Founders all that has been ſince built upon the Foundations they firſt laid, as it ſhall be made appear more at large in the ſecond Part of this Work.</p>
               <p>The third Propoſition concerning the Evidence of the Proofs of Revelation, its perpetual Subſiſtence, and the Perſpicuity of its Expreſſions, does ſuppoſe, that the Deſign of God was to teach Men his Will
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:59986:36"/>mathematically, which is a Suppoſition contrary to the preſent State of Mankind; a State of Liberty, wherein Laws and not Demonſtrations are propos'd to them. Suppoſing that God would appoint Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments, he could not lead Men to Vertue, nor avert them from Vice, otherwiſe than by Laws whereof the Senſe could not be more clear, and yet the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Authority of them be never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematically demonſtrated. If all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind were convinc'd of the Truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and of the Senſe of it, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Proofs, no body then could reſiſt it. There could be, conſequently, no Puniſhments for the guilty, becauſe none would be guilty; nor could there be any more Reward; for what Recompence can a Man expect for aſſenting to a mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Demonſtration?</p>
               <p>It will be demanded, perhaps, why God ſhould govern Man after this manner, and not mathematically, as ſome Unbelievers would have him? But I'm not bound to account for God's Bounty, which he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſifies as he pleaſes, for Reaſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us: 'Tis enough that I prove he cannot be accus'd of Injuſtice; and this, I'm perſwaded, I can perfectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, the Divine Laws are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionated to the Nature of Man, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may ſay who have not ſtudy'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59986:37"/>them as they ought. 'Tis an undoubted Truth, agreed upon by all Chriſtian Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, That God does not damn any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon barely for violating his Laws, but for not leaving his ill Habits, that being the Man's own Fault. I ſhall inſiſt no longer upon this, leſt I digreſs too far from the Subject I treat of in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>What I conclude from all I have ſaid, is, That Unbelievers do frequently take ill-grounded Prejudices for clear Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, from which they haſtily judg of the whole Chriſtian Religion. I have alledg'd plain Examples of it, and could have brought ſeveral more; but thoſe cited by me may ſuffice to make a reaſonable Man take care of paſſing ſuch precipitant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions. This is all that I require in this place, and which the moſt incredulous Man living cannot, without extreme Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, refuſe me. Now, I'm perſwaded if Unbelievers would take the pains to look back upon the firſt Propoſitions which they build upon, that they ſhould perceive a great part of them could by no means paſs for Axioms; and then they would quickly acknowledg how little Solidity was to be found in their other Principles.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="4" type="chapter">

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> That many are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers, becauſe they know not how to reaſon rightly.</head>
               <p>IN the preceding Chapters I ſuppos'd that Unbelievers did not reaſon well, and that, without perceiving it, they ſuffer'd themſelves to be ſeduc'd by their Paſſions or Prejudices; but I did at the ſame time ſuppoſe that they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd by Arguments, when they were ſhew'd that they follow'd not the Rules of good Senſe. But there are more than one kind of Unbelievers; and ſome of them, thoſe I mean who are to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Chapter, are Unbelievers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other Account, but becauſe they cannot reaſon well, as I ſhall preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
               <p>But we muſt remark before, that, the Chriſtian Religion conſiſting in Doctrines and Matters of Fact, to prove both theſe we muſt make long Reaſonings, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg many Proofs depending upon one another. Thus to perceive the Force of thoſe Reaſons brought to prove the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Chriſtian Religion, we muſt be capable not only of underſtanding eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Propoſition or every Argument by it ſelf; but likewiſe to enter into the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59986:38"/>of all that is ſaid, by examining the Connection of the Reaſonings, and the Relations which a great number of Idea. have towards one another. But there are a world of People who entertain a good Opinion of themſelves, and are not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nevertheleſs, of this Examination nor to conſider diſtinctly ſo great a Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch compounded and perplex'd Ideas.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be immediately told, no doubt, That if this be ſo, I do but loſe my time in reaſoning with them; ſince I ſuppoſe that they are not capable to know the Solidity of an Argument. Yet two things oblige me to do it, whereof the firſt and principal is, that what I have to ſay upon this Subject may contribute to keep thoſe who are perſwaded of the Truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, from being ſeduc'd by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this ſort of Unbelievers. An infinite number of People who believe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion true, know not the Proofs of it ſo perfectly, and are not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in their Belief, but that they may be tempted by the Example of thoſe Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers who reaſon little. They are of all Qualities and Conditions; and the haughty Air whereby they reject Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not ſometimes leſs dangerous that the moſt ſpecious Sophiſtry.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, It may happen that ſuch as are not Maſters of the true Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59986:38"/>of Reaſoning, may notwithſtanding be in a Condition of leaving their Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and of making a better Uſe of their Underſtandings. It is very fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this ſort of People that they are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Unbelievers, becauſe they know not how to govern their Thoughts. But I grant that thoſe who are grown old in this kind of Ignorance, and whoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is encreas'd by their Age, are in a manner incurable, go to work with them how you will; eſpecially if any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality be join'd to this want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which never fails ſcarcely to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: Nor is it for ſuch that we write, as Books of Phyſick are not written about incurable Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>To be perſwaded our ſelves that there are, in effect, ſome People who for want of knowing how to reaſon refuſe their Aſſent to the Goſpel, we need only reflect a little upon the preſent State of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and upon what we know of many Unbelievers which live among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Such as undertake to convert the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and the other Idolaters of <hi>Aſia, America,</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> after taking a great deal of pains to learn their Language, are forc'd to take much more when they would by reaſoning perſwade them of the Falſity of their Religions, and of the Truth of that of Jeſus Chriſt. The Monks may long enough make all imaginable Efforts
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59986:39"/>to become intelligible to thoſe ignorant People, and to convince them of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity of their Idolatry, and the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereupon it is built; but although this thing be ſo plain, yet there are but few of them who can be made to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and fewer that conceive the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon which Chriſtianity is grounded.</p>
               <p>'Tis not neceſſary that I ſpeak here of the Means which the Miſſionaries have choſen to employ in their Converſions, rather than Reaſon. This makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to my Deſign. I ſhall only remark, that the Difficulty of bringing thoſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Nations to receive the Goſpel, proceeds not from any Inſidelity peculiar to them from the People of <hi>Europe.</hi> They are, upon the contrary, the moſt credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous People in the World, and very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly embrace a great number of incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, whereof their Theology is made up. Their Incredulity, with reſpect to the Goſpel, proceeds from their not reaſoning almoſt at all, except about things relating to Life; and that nothing ever enters into their Minds except from Experience or Education. They are not Men that meditate, and are capable of attentively conſidering abſtracted Ideas, nor of comparing them with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to draw ſome Conſequence from them. So for want of meeting a little reaſoning in theſe People, one is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59986:39"/>puzzl'd how to get 'em to change their Opinions.</p>
               <p>This cannot be ſaid of the Mahometans, ſince we know that their Divines do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times write with Subtlety and Senſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt ſome of the Doctrines which the Miſſionaries would have 'em embrace. Nor can we treat them as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels that reject the Chriſtian Religion out of a Spirit of Scepticiſm; for they are every thing rather than <hi>Pyrrhonians,</hi> ſeeing they moſt heartily believe all the Alcoran. Nevertheleſs, altho they have Senſe enough (as I ſaid) to make Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt ſome Doctrines that are preach'd to them, yet they have not enough to examine the Principles of their own Religion, and to ſee upon what it is grounded. They don't ſo much as underſtand what is ſaid to them upon that Head, nor the Reaſons brought to prove the Truth of Chriſtianity. And if the Miſſionaries now and then convert ſome of 'em, it is not from any Reaſons they alledg, but in gaining their Love and Eſteem by ſome other ways.</p>
               <p>The Jews are much in the ſame Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it may be ſeen by the Books they have written to eſtabliſh their own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or to confute thoſe of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. This may be eaſily diſcover'd alſo by any that diſcourſes with them upon theſe Subjects. But between them and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59986:40"/>the Mahometans there is this Difference, that the latter give Credit to a Book full of Impertinencies and Falſhoods; whereas the Jews ground their Perſwaſion upon the Books of the Old Teſtament, which contain a true Revelation. And yet they can reaſon little better than the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans; which is one of the greateſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles to their Converſion. Whilſt they are ſatisfy'd with the mere Authority of ſome Rabbins, tho without any Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are Proof againſt the ſtrongeſt Reaſons the Chriſtians can oppoſe to 'em; becauſe from their Infancy they are wont to believe what their Rabbins tell them, and are never taught to reaſon juſtly.</p>
               <p>Otherwiſe, if the Jews were in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of purſuing an Argument, and of diſtinguiſhing a good from an ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it would then be very eaſy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of the Truth of Chriſtianity. It ſhould be only needful, as ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Divines have lately done, to put them upon proving the Truth of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Miſſion of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they would prove it to a Heathen they deſign'd to proſelyte to Judaiſm. For if they bring any ſolid Proofs for this matter, it may be eaſily made evident, that theſe ſame Reaſons are incomparably ſtronger in favour of the divine Miſſion of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, than in favour of that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> as it has been ſhewn in the Book whoſe

Judaeo.</note>Now then, to convince the Jews and other Infidels by Reaſon, they muſt be firſt taught the Art of methodically di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting their Thoughts, and be accuſtomed to reaſon ſtricly upon other Heads, that they may learn to underſtand the Force of the Proofs upon which the Goſpel is founded. But this is what all the Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries in the World are not able to do, eſpecially to thoſe Inſidels who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in Years. It were Injuſtice to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that 'tis only amongſt Infidels that Men are found uncapable of diſcerning the Goodneſs of an Argument; and who, upon this account, reject the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. There are Unbelievers among Chriſtians themſelves, who are not only ſuch out of ſome Diſpoſition engaging them againſt the Goſpel, but likewiſe out of downright Stupidity, and for want of underſtanding the Reaſons whereupon Chriſtianity is grounded.</p>
               <p>There are ſome People who from their Childhood have been brought up to ſome Trade, or other conſtant Buſineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Care taken about the forming of their Minds, or even of inſtructing them in Religion; and who, being moreover of a Genius not very proper for conceiving of things reveal'd, tho haughty and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, have grown to a full Age with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any farther Inſtruction, or being cur'd
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59986:41"/>of their Pride. Theſe are rarely perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion; nay, they frequently reject it entirely, or at leaſt, in part: not only becauſe they know not the Proofs of it, but alſo becauſe they underſtand them not, when they hear them from thoſe that do know them. Theſe unpoliſh'd and ignorant Creatures imagine that there is nothing true, but what they perceive by their Senſes, or what they have found by their own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to be poſſible, or, in a word, what they find conformable to their Paſſions. Thus neither the ſpeculative Doctrines of Religion, nor the Practice of it, nor yet the Hiſtory of thoſe who taught it being within the Verge of their Knowledg, they refuſe to believe them rather out of Brutality and Stupidity, than as deceiv'd by captious Reaſonings. If they reject it not altogether, 'tis certain however that they retain only what is moſt pleaſing to them; which is an evident Demonſtration that they are not perſwaded of it from Reaſoning and Knowledg; becauſe the Proofs which confirm a part of it, are the ſame that ſhew the whole Religion to be true.</p>
               <p>'Tis not only amongſt People taken up with Trade and Buſineſs that this ſort of Unbelievers is to be found; for there are more of 'em, perhaps, amongſt ſuch as aſpire to great Preferments, amongſt Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59986:41"/>and Perſons of Quality. It may be ſaid indeed, that Perſons of theſe Ranks have had a better Education than others, with relation to the Affairs of the World, and thoſe Employments to which they were deſign'd: But in very truth, it is as common a thing to hear them reaſon as wretchedly about Religion, as the moſt ignorant among the Populace. When once they are grown old in their Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt Chriſtianity, then their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Vanity, encreas'd with their Age, renders them more obſtinate, and not ſeldom makes 'em altogether inacceſſible to Truth. You propoſe the moſt cogent Arguments to them in vain; for they look upon them as mere Sophiſms, tho they know not wherein Sophiſtry differs from ſolid Reaſoning.</p>
               <p>I ſhall be told, perhaps, that this ſort of Men is not ſo ignorant of the Art of Thinking as I ſuppoſe them to be, ſeeing they reaſon not ſo ill concerning thoſe things they know by Experience, and that they govern themſelves with Prudence enough in the Affairs of Life. To this I anſwer, That I do not deny but thoſe, I ſpeak of, may reaſon very well about what are the Objects of their Paſſions, or when they confine themſelves within the Limits of their Experience. But I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that they have not as much as the Notion of reaſoning ſolidly about ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59986:42"/>things, that make no Impreſſions upon the Senſes; ſuch as are the Proofs whereupon the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion is built.</p>
               <p>To be convinc'd of this, we need only examine them, if we can, upon theſe two Heads. Firſt, We muſt diſcourſe 'em about ſome abſtracted Subject; ſuch as are, for Example, the general Ideas of moſt things, the Notions of Vertues and Vices: And if they reaſon exactly herein, we may juſtly conclude, that theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not of their number who continue Unbelievers, for want of knowing how to reaſon rightly. But if we hear them talk of ſuch Matters without any Principles or Coherence, if we ſee that they do not comprehend what is ſaid to them upon ſuch Occaſions, be it never ſo clear, or notwithſtanding all the Pains taken to make it plain, (which happens but too frequently) then it will be eaſily granted me, that their Infidelity does, at leaſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in part from their Ignorance of the Art of Reaſoning.</p>
               <p>Another way we have to diſcover this kind of Unbelievers, is, when we find them diſtaſted with all Diſcourſes upon abſtracted Matters, or with any thing that relates not to their Paſſions; when they avoid the reading of all Books requiring any Attention, eſpecially of ſuch Books as are written to prove the Truth of what
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59986:42"/>they disbelieve; finally, when they won't enter upon a Diſcuſſion of any ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, nor will be at the Pains of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Anſwers of Believers with the Objections of the Incredulous. We may ſufficiently know ſuch Perſons, who are, ſo to ſpeak, ſo fill'd with what they have learn'd from Experience of the Affairs of the World, that nothing elſe can enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and are diſpleas'd when they hear other Diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>Such was <hi>Feſtus,</hi> for Inſtance, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Judea,</hi> who is mention'd in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi> He could ſcarcely hear a ſhort Diſcourſe from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and charg'd him with Madneſs, after hearing from him another Diſcourſe full of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and good Senſe. Were he told of ſome Methods how to ſqueeze Money dexterouſly out of his Province, or were he acquainted with ſome Intrigue that might contribute to prefer him to a more conſiderable Poſt, he would immediately underſtand what was ſaid to him; or he would get it repeated to him ſo often, and would have ask'd ſo many Queſtions about it, that he ſhould at leaſt have an exact Notion of the Buſineſs. But becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke to him of things no way relating to his Deſigns or Paſſions, he could ſcarce patiently hear him, and underſtood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his Diſcourſe.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:59986:43"/>
               <p>There are a world of People at this day in the midſt of Chriſtendom, who are very near in the ſame Diſpoſition. They ſpeak very well of their Temporal Affairs, or any thing belonging to them; they willingly converſe about the News of the Times, and that ſometimes with Senſe enough; but put them once by ſuch things to talk of Religion, they are preſently tir'd, they ſpeak of it ridiculouſly, they ſhew, in a word, ſo great a Contempt of ſuch Diſcourſes, as if they were Matters beneath them, and to which they cannot ſtoop without Uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p>As theſe Unbelievers, who reaſon not at all, are moreover entirely poſſeſt with Paſſions oppoſite to the Goſpel, and have been long habituated to obey them; ſo they are not acceſſible on any ſide, and I ſee not how, without a Miracle, they can be convinc'd of their miſerable State, nor reclaim'd from their Error. However it was fit to make ſome Reflections upon this ſort of Unbelievers, that we might not be impos'd upon when we meet with ſuch, nor ſeduc'd by their Ways.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> That the Neglect of ſearching into Truth is often the Cauſe of Incredulity.</head>
               <p>THere are many Men who have na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a Genius good enough for abſtracted Matters, and that alſo were not wholly neglected in their firſt Education; but whom the Courſe of their Lives has engag'd in Occupations which have no Affinity with the Search of Truth. The Neceſſaries of their Families, or the Deſire of ſatisfying their Paſſions, do ſo take up their Minds for ſeveral Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that they neglect all other things, never improve their natural Parts, nor diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſhood, with any Application, in the Buſineſs of Religion. This Negligence leads 'em inſenſibly into Doubting; for if the Connection of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Truths be not heedfully attended to, there ariſe a thouſand Difficulties in the Mind, out of which we know not how to extricate our ſelves. From Doubt Men eaſily fall into Infidelity, whilſt they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Search of what may remove their Scruples: for when once they are got into the Underſtanding, they are in motion upon all occaſions; and as the Solutions to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59986:44"/>them are not ſtudy'd after at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, we ſhould not wonder if in time they take ſuch deep rooting, as it ſhall not be an eaſy Matter afterwards to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate them.</p>
               <p>If ſuch as refuſe to believe the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion ſeriouſly examine themſelves, I am much miſtaken if the greateſt Part of 'em won't confeſs that they have extremely neglected the Care they ought to have us'd, in order to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of a thing of ſuch Importance. Nay, I dare affirm that there is not any Unbeliever who perceives not, if he minds it, that this Negligence is one of the principal Cauſes of his Incredulity: and I ſhall bring many Proofs of it in the Sequel of this Work.</p>
               <p>Now, to make what I have ſaid more evident, I will inſtance this Fault in other Perſons, where People may remark it more impartially than in themſelves. When Chriſtianity begun to make a Noiſe in <hi>Judea,</hi> that is, chiefly when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles declar'd every where the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Maſter, and ſhew'd that he wanted not faithful Diſciples on Earth, tho he was himſelf no more there; all the <hi>Jews</hi> ought, one would think, to have inform'd themſelves of what theſe Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſaid, ſeeing they were things moſt nearly concerning them to know. They expected their <hi>Meſſias</hi> about that time;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59986:44"/>they groan'd ſo heavily under the <hi>Roman</hi> Tyranny, that they wiſh'd for nothing ſo much as Liberty, and they hop'd the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias</hi> ſhould prove their Deliverer. In this Diſpoſition they ought to hearken, I ſhould think, to every one that ſpoke to 'em of a Meſſias, to get rid of their Doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wiſh'd Deliverer was yet come or not. Methinks too the Apoſtles ſhould have been heard of all the World, when they preach'd the Doctrine and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of their Maſter, eſpecially his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; for indeed theſe Miracles were ſo great and many, that more could not be expected from the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The Diſciples of the Apoſtles ſaid in all Places, that not only <hi>Jeſus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> whom the Jews had crucify'd, did work numberleſs Miracles whilſt he dwelt among Men; but that he alſo left the ſame Power to his Apoſtles, and that, in effect, they wrought Miracles every Day. What could be ſaid more to excite the Curioſity of the Jews? They were not in the Judgment of the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> who thought no Miracles were to be wrought; nor did they believe that God would ſend them no more Prophets to work any: on the contrary, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the greateſt of all the Prophets. And notwithſtanding, they gave ſo little heed to what the Apoſtles ſaid, that the Chief of their Nation ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took notice of 'em, unleſs it was to
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59986:45"/>uſe 'em ill, without examining in the leaſt the Ground of their Doctrine. We have two Jewiſh Authors who liv'd in the time of the Apoſtles, namely, <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph;</hi> but nevertheleſs they did not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to inform themſelves about theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as may be ſeen by their Writings. <hi>Philo</hi> wrote a great many Books, whereof the moſt part are allegorical Diſcourſes upon the Old Teſtament: now in ſome of theſe he had a thouſand Occaſions to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Goſpel, if he had any Idea of it. If he disbeliev'd the Truth of it, he ſhould, at leaſt, have endeavour'd to confute it ſomewhere: but he ſays not a word for or againſt it, which is ſign enough that he knew not what it was. I know very well how <hi>Euſebius</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Eccleſiaſt. l. 2. c. 17. <hi>See</hi> Joſ. Scaliger, l. 7. de Emendat. Temp.

But nothing, except a deſire of confounding the Jews by their own Authors, could diſcover Chriſtians to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius,</hi> and thoſe that followed him, in the Deſcription of the <hi>Therapeutes,</hi> where one Syllable is not ſpoken of Jeſus Chriſt, nor of his Doctrine; and where all that <hi>Philo</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59986:45"/>ſays does perfectly quadrate to ſome of the <hi>Eſſeans,</hi> who form'd, as 'tis well known, a particular Sect among the Jews. The Deſire of convincing Infidels ſhould not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to make uſe of weak Proofs againſt them; for certainly ſuch Methods muſt needs render 'em more averſe to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>What I have now ſaid will be eaſily granted me by Men of any tolerable Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Judgment: But it may be diſputed with reſpect to<note n="†" place="margin">Antiq. Jud. l. 18. c. 4, &amp; 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Joſeph,</hi> by reaſon of a Paſſage or two produc'd out of him, wherein he ſpeaks of Jeſus Chriſt. This is not the Place to examine theſe Paſſages, which learned Men<note n="‖" place="margin">See <hi>Le Fevre</hi> in his Critical Letters.</note> believe were inſerted by ſome Chriſtian into the Text of <hi>Joſeph.</hi> But be this as it will, 'tis manifeſt that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſays nothing of the Slaughter of the Children whereof St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks, nor of moſt part of the Circumſtances of the Life of Chriſt, nor of his Doctrine; nor can he be ſuppos'd by any to have been acquainted with Chriſtianity, except by ſuch as never read his Works. Had he known a part of the Diſcourſes and Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt, he would not have been content to mention him only <hi>en paſſant,</hi> and in ſo few Words; he would be large upon that Subject, no doubt, as it well deſerv'd. It may be therefore po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively affirm'd, that <hi>Joſeph,</hi> how exact ſoever reputed to be in other Matters,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59986:46"/>did ſhamefully neglect informing himſelf about the Chriſtian Religion, altho no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could have been more eaſy for him.

                  <hi>Suetonius,</hi> have ſpoken of it, and wanted not Opportunities to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, tho it appears they did not. They were polite and learned Men, and had ſpent, according to the Cuſtom of thoſe Ages, a great deal of time in the Study of the Greek Philoſophy. Now this Philoſophy was not upon any account comparable to the Doctrine or Morals of the Goſpel; nor could the Learned of <hi>Rome</hi> neglect theſe things only becauſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi> as the Grecians ſpoke, had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd them; for they well knew that the moſt famous Sages of <hi>Greece</hi> had undertaken long Voyages to the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> to learn their Opinions. What made them contemn the Chriſtians then? We need not ſeek for any other Reaſon, but a ſcandalous Neglect, proceeding from the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Paſſion of moſt People: for ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily they apply themſelves only to what is eſteem'd in the World, and that may contribute to have them taken notice of in the Places of their Abode.

                  </note> Greeks were for a long time in great Repute at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Perſons of the firſt Quality did value themſelves upon theſe ſorts of Knowledg: but the Goſpel was unknown there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it contain'd not any Doctrine proper to add more Luſtre to ſuch as did aſpire to the greateſt Dignities.</p>
               <p>Something of this Nature made the Athenians neglect the Opportunity they had in their Hands of underſtanding the Goſpel, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> was in their City to preach it, if they would hear him: and, queſtionleſs, they would have heard him, had they as much good Senſe as they had Vanity.

                  <note place="margin">Acts 17.18, 22.</note> and after liſtening a while to him about the Reſurrection of the Dead, ſome of 'em laugh'd at him, others put him off till ſome other time, and there were but a ſmall Number of them that receiv'd the Doctrine which he preach'd to them. This proceeded in part from a blameable Neglect that would not let them inform themſelves throughly about what St. <hi>Paul</hi> declar'd, altho on the other ſide, the Athenians, and the Strangers who follow'd their Studies there, were Men of much Leiſure, and great Lovers of News.<note place="margin">Ver. 21.]</note> But the Apoſtle not teaching his Doctrine after the manner of the Philoſophers they were wont to hear, whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Method or the Elocution,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59986:47"/>they were out of Conceit with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe with them, that the outward Appearance of S. <hi>Paul</hi> was not ſo taking as that of their Philoſophers; but ſhould this extinguiſh their Curioſity? Is Truth always neceſſarily accompanied with Eloquence? None of them durſt maintain ſuch a thing. Notwithſtanding, S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s being there did 'em no good; and they neglected acquainting themſelves with his Doctrine, which was infinitely more reaſonable than that of their Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers. They loſt a world of time in the Study of very ridiculous Doctrines, as were the Phyſicks of all their Philoſophers, without excepting any; and the Morals of the greateſt part, to ſpeak nothing of their Dialectick or Logicks. There was not one Philoſopher who had any reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, no nor a probable Hypotheſis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, except the Platoniſts, who accommodated their Opinions ſo much to vulgar Notions, that by this Medley of Good and Bad, they render'd all the Good they ſpoke unprofitable and fruitleſs. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, ſuch as ſpent all their time to hear this ſort of People, did not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe, out of an unpardonable Negligence, to underſtand what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to them.</p>
               <p>One would think no body could at this time of day be guilty of the like Fault among Chriſtians, ſince they generally
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59986:47"/>profeſs to believe that none can better ſpend his time than in diſcovering the Principles upon which Chriſtianity is grounded. But the Actions of Chriſtians not being always conformable to their Belief, it happens but too frequently, that their Courſe of Life produces an Effect quite contrary to what the Chriſtian Profeſſion ſhould beget in them. Altho it be not ſaid by any, that it were better employing himſelf about any thing elſe than in the Study of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; yet the Carriage of moſt Men is commonly ſuch, as if they believed this. A Man who entirely neglects this Study, but duly makes his Court to thoſe that can advance him, or keep him in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Poſt; a Man that paſſes all his Life in heaping up Riches, tho he be in a profound Ignorance about the Grounds of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity; this Man, I ſay, is he for all this the leſs eſteemed? The moſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perſon in the World, but who is not reſpected for his Preferments, nor conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd for his Riches, is he comparable to this other ignorant, but rich or honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Man? Not at all, according to the conſtant Practice of moſt Chriſtians. This Practice cries much louder, if we may ſpeak ſo, than the Evangelical Maxims it contradicts, and ſeems to ſay to thoſe who are entring into the World, that it concerns 'em little to learn the Reaſons
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59986:48"/>of aſſenting to Chriſtianity, but that it is of great Importance to obtain ſome Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or to enrich themſelves, to which this ſame Chriſtianity contributes nothing. It falls out likewiſe but too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that this dangerous Leſſon is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the Example of many conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſons, who after neglecting the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Religion as much as they cultivate the Art of Advancing themſelves in the World, or of making their Fortune, are nevertheleſs in great Eſteem, and in ſuch advantageous Poſts, that their Lot appears worthy of Envy; whilſt ſuch as might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form others by their Knowledg, live in Contempt and Obſcurity.</p>
               <p>This general Cuſtom which obtains al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every where, does throw People in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Neglect of Religion ſo much the more eaſily as they find themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd not to obſerve the Precepts of it. Thus ſlighting that Science which ſignifies nothing as to their worldly Affairs, and whoſe Conſequences would engage them to reſiſt thoſe Paſſions to which they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly abandon themſelves, they think as little as poſſibly they can upon thoſe Proofs which perſwade us of the Truth of the Goſpel. After this it happens, that ſome occaſion of Doubt comes into their Mind which begets Difficulties, out of which they cannot extricate themſelves for want of Knowledg; and this at laſt
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59986:48"/>produces a formal Infidelity, which is not eaſily to be cur'd, eſpecially if it be of any Continuance.</p>
               <p>'Tis by ſo much the more dangerous to fall into this Negligence I'm treating of, as the Cauſes whence it ſprings are always in being, and act inceſſantly upon the Underſtanding with a great deal of force; whilſt that which might incline People to be inſtructed in the Reaſons of believing the Goſpel acts but weakly, and is ſtifl'd, as it were, every moment by the Example of the more numerous Party.</p>
               <p>But there is likewiſe another thing, that may greatly contribute in ſeducing ſuch as are otherwiſe Men of good Senſe. 'Tis an Argument they frame without percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, and which at firſt ſight appears ſolid enough. When they ſee that thoſe who make a Profeſſion of believing the Chriſtian Religion true, obey nothing of it but juſt as much as their worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt obliges them to do; they imagine that moſt Men act a part only, and pretend to believe what they really do not; or elſe they conclude, that Perſons ſo injudicious as to contradict their Belief upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, are but an ill Example to follow in this reſpect, and that it were better done of Men to regulate their Perſwaſion by their Conduct; ſeeing, as they ſuppoſe, they cannot change the latter. Thus they imitate pretty well the Actions of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59986:49"/>greateſt part of the World, but they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves exalted above the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in as much, at leaſt, as they have Principles conformable to their Practice. If they neglect informing themſelves in Religion, this proceeds from their not believing the Truth of it; and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate not their Manners according to its Precepts, 'tis becauſe they give no Credit to the Recompences promis'd thoſe who ſhall obſerve them, nor to the Pains where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are menac'd that violate them. In a word, they act coherently; whereas the Life of others is a perpetual Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, it is moſt certain, that they are hugely out in their Judgment of the greateſt part of Chriſtians. 'Tis not true, that the Multitude feigns only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Truth of Chriſtianity; and 'tis alſo falſe, that Injudiciouſneſs makes them contradict their Belief by their Practice. 'Tis much better to preſerve our Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion entire, even when we contradict it by our Actions, than to ſute the Doctrines of it to the Conduct we follow.</p>
               <p>And I prove it thus. In the firſt place, a Man may ſincerely believe a Principle to be good and reaſonable, and yet not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Life accordingly. The Reaſon hereof is, that what ſets moſt Mens Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons a going, is not ſo much the Light of the Underſtanding as the Diſpoſition of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59986:49"/>the Heart, and the Paſſions, which are not ſeldom entirely repugnant to this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. No body, for Example, will deny but that Bribery ought to have no place in a well-govern'd State, and that all Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments ſhould be conferr'd upon thoſe only who deſerve 'em; nay, the Laws do every where condemn Bribery. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs there are few Perſons that do not ſollicit for themſelves or for their Friends when any opportunity of Advancement offers it ſelf. We find alſo, that Men are agreed about the Uſefulneſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of a great number of Laws, which they break nevertheleſs every day, when they reap any preſent Advantage from it. We may alledg a more evident Example of this Contradiction between our Underſtanding and Practice. A gouty Man who contracted this troubleſome Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper by drinking too much Wine, doubts not in the leaſt, but that the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Uſe of this Liquor muſt needs prove very hurtful to him; notwithſtanding, the preſent Pleaſure he finds in drinking car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it, and he cannot forbear drinking more than he ſhould. And thus it is with ſeveral other Paſſions. In like manner, People whoſe Deſires are contrary to the Spirit of the Goſpel, may indulge thoſe Deſires, without calling into queſtion all the while the Truth of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:59986:50"/>
               <p>In the ſecond place, the Manners of moſt Chriſtians are contrary to their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, not that they perceive not this Oppoſition well enough, and condemn it too, when they think of it; but the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Living generally receiv'd, and that's moſt agreeable to their Paſſions, carries it over the Judgment they make of themſelves in their own Conſciences; and we may be convinc'd of it by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples already alledg'd, and by thouſands of the like nature.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, It cannot be hence concluded that we muſt judg of Religion according to our Inclinations, nor that we may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate it rather to our manner of living, than continue to believe what we do not obey. Who will maintain that a Prince would do better in changing the Laws according to his preſent Paſſions, than to let them ſubſiſt, and break 'em every hour? No body. For if he obſerves not the Laws as he ſhould, he leaves them their Authority however with reſpect to his Subjects, and ſuch other Princes as are willing to obſerve them; which is of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity to Society. What Diſorders would it cauſe in the Commonwealth, if an adulterous Prince, leſt he ſhould be thought to contemn their Authority, would abrogate all thoſe Laws prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Adultery?<note place="margin">Herodot. l. 3. c. 31.</note> 'Tis ſaid that <hi>Cambyſes</hi> the Son of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> being in Love with his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59986:50"/>Siſter, and deſirous of marrying her, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of the Royal Judges, who were the Interpreters of the Laws amongſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> whether it was lawful for a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have his Siſter to Wife? They anſwer'd him, That there was no Law which permitted it; but that there was another Law that permitted the Kings of <hi>Perſia</hi> to do whatever they pleas'd. Upon this Anſwer, <hi>Cambyſes</hi> marry'd his Siſter; and the <hi>Perſians</hi> have not from that time ſcrupl'd to imitate their King in this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. It had queſtionleſs been leſs crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and much leſs hurtful to the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if <hi>Cambyſes</hi> had marry'd his Siſter without ſaying any thing of it, and not endeavour to cover his Inceſt by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Law.</p>
               <p>If it be ask'd then, Which Carriage is moſt dangerous and blameable, that of ſuch as violate the Laws of the Goſpel whom they believe to be Divine, or that of the Incredulous who reject the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe Laws becauſe they have no mind to obey them. 'Tis plain, that the latter is much worſe than the former, ſuppoſing the Laws of the Goſpel to be beneficial to Society, which cannot be doubted, as I have ſhewn in the firſt Chapter.</p>
               <p>So, whatever be the Conduct of thoſe who profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers cannot however excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59986:51"/>becauſe others do not act coherent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing they neglect to underſtand what imports them moſt to know. The greateſt part of Chriſtians are doubtleſs in the wrong herein, and they deny it not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but the Incredulous are much more to blame than they. If the latter would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themſelves, they might diſcover, perhaps, ſome other Source of this Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in their own Perſons; and it is, that generally they are not very ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous about knowing the Truth in Matters of Religion.</p>
               <p>There are ſome People ſo much taken up with the preſent, and having ſo good an Opinion of themſelves, that they ſhut their Eyes and Ears to all ſorts of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe or Examples, which might convince them that they have reaſon not to be well ſatisfy'd with their Opinions and Practice. Altho they ſeem ſometimes to love the Truth, yet, if it be well remark'd, it will appear that they love nothing but their Paſſions, and are careful only how to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge theſe; for they receive no more of the Truth, but what is not incompatible with their Deſires. Thus Princes, and Perſons of great Quality, cannot bear that ſuch as are about them ſhould ingenuouſly acquaint them with what is ſaid of them, and tell beſides their own Thoughts of the Matter. If any is a little too ſincere, he's quickly baniſh'd from their Preſence. 'Tis
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59986:51"/>juſt ſo with many private Perſons, who take none for their Friends but ſuch as flatter them, and help to keep them up in the good Opinion they have conceiv'd of themſelves. Princes and private Men do equally drive out of their Minds all Thoughts that might trouble their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and hinder them from quietly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying what they love. They cannot ſay therefore, that they are ſuch mighty Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Truth, who care for knowing no more of it than what is pleaſing to them. And it may probably happen that many Unbelievers deal after this manner with Religion, neglecting to underſtand what might convince them, out of a ſecret Averſeneſs they have of ſearching into ſuch Truths as they cannot diſcover with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out extremely diſquieting themſelves. So S. <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoning before <hi>Felix,</hi> of Juſtice,<note place="margin">Acts 24.25.</note> Temperance, and future Judgment, this trembling Governour was quickly weary of hearing him, and put him off till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time. Had S. <hi>Paul</hi> entertain'd him with ſome other Diſcourſe, he would have heard him, it may be, as long as he pleas'd: but the Vertues whereof this Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeak to him, were too oppoſite to his Manners to obtain a longer Audience from him. 'Tis evident then, that this Diſpoſition is entirely againſt all good Senſe, and the whole World does equally blame Flattery and Flatterers. 'Tis ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59986:52"/>agreed upon likewiſe, that there is nothing more remote from Wiſdom, than wilfully to continue ignorant of what is diſadvantageous to us; for without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, we can never bring a Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and our Ignorance about it changes not the Nature of the thing, but contributes not ſeldom to render our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition worſe. The Incredulous therefore ought to look to it, and not fear to hazard their Repoſe in the Search of diſquieting Truths. They ought to beware of that ill regulated Self-love, which flatters our preſent Paſſions, and avoids every thing that may mix ſome Bitterneſs with the Sweetneſs we taſte in the Enjoyment of them. For my part, I'm perſwaded that their Negligence of informing themſelves about the Grounds of Chriſtianity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in great part from this dangerous Diſpoſition; and they would agree to it, no doubt, were they capable of examining themſelves.</p>
               <p>Did we ſee Unbelievers uſe much Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication in the Search of Truth, without omitting any thing that was neceſſary for their thorough Information, and yet not quit their Infidelity; we ſhould, perhaps, be tempted to believe that they were in the right, ſeeing they did not conclude but after a long and requiſite Diſcuſſion. But we ſee not one of them ſo diſpos'd, and they are all contented with a very ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59986:52"/>Knowledg of Religion, without endeavouring to penetrate into the Proofs of it; which gives us occaſion to confirm our ſelves in the Belief of the Truth, and to be perſwaded that their Infidelity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, as I have prov'd, from their Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of due Inſtruction.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> That Lazineſs may keep many People in Ignorance, Doubts, and Incredulity.</head>
               <p>WE may reduce thoſe who make Profeſſion of believing Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to two Orders of Men. Some embrace it rather from the Authority of ſuch as they eſteem, than for having exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the Proofs of it; and we may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, that theſe are the greater number. There are, however, many underſtanding Perſons, who believe the Truth of the Goſpel for no other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe, after examining the Proofs of it, they have been fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd. We may alſo divide Unbelievers into two Parties. The one have in ſome ſort examin'd the Reaſons upon which Chriſtians build their Belief, but have not judg'd them worthy of Aſſent, either becauſe they knew not how to examine
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59986:53"/>them as they ought, or for ſome other Reaſon which I will not ſtay to examine now. The other ſort have never trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themſelves about examining them, and yet they ſtick not to pronounce our Proofs not convincing. They might be led to this haſty Judgment by divers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; or ſeveral Paſſions might contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute together to throw 'em into Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. 'Tis not neceſſary that I enter upon a nice Diſcuſſion of theſe Motives and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. What I have ſaid in general or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the foregoing Chapters, may ſuffice to oblige Unbelievers to retire, as it were, into themſelves, and to preſerve them from the Deluſions of Self-Love. I muſt nevertheleſs add here ſome Remarks upon one of the particular Sources of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity, which is but too common, and whereof I have not yet ſpoken any thing.</p>
               <p>This Source is Lazineſs, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many People to remove out of their Minds whatever demands Attention, and that makes no Impreſſion upon them by their Senſes, or by their Paſſions. We meet with ſome who have Underſtanding and Judgment enough to examine rightly the Proofs of Chriſtianity, if they would apply themſelves to it. But the long Habit they have acquir'd of not exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any of theſe abſtracted Ideas which require ſome Application, makes them ſo averſe to this Examen, that it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59986:53"/>to perſwade them to it, whilſt they remain in this Diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>To conquer it, if this can be, and to cure thoſe who indulge themſelves in it; or to keep others, at leaſt, from falling into it, we muſt examine it in its Riſe, Progreſs, and Conſequences: for if we can ſhew that it is the moſt unreaſonable thing in the World in it ſelf, and in its Conſequences the moſt dangerous, it muſt be neceſſarily granted, that it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a Man of good Senſe to give way to it.</p>
               <p>In the preſent State of humane Nature, it is certain that nothing can more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excite our Attention than what ſtrikes our Senſes, or awakens ſome of our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Whatever is convey'd into the Mind by either of theſe ways, does ſo move and occupy it, that if the Senſations be lively, and the Paſſions quick, no other thing can enter whilſt they act there. And Men have naturally an Averſion to all things beſides; for if a Man continues long in this Diſpoſition without making any Attempt to ſubdue it, it happens at laſt, that tho he be extremely active with regard to ſenſible things, and thoſe Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to which he has given up himſelf; he falls nevertheleſs into a ſurprizing Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to all other Matters, and will not hear of reading or examining any thing that has no relation to them. As the
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59986:54"/>Lazineſs of the Body proceeds from ſuch an extreme Love to the Pleaſure of that Repoſe to which we are accuſtom'd, that we cannot think of loſing it without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſo the Lazineſs of the Mind, which I'm now treating of, does ſo ſeize upon all thoſe who entertain it, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhake it off without great Pains and Moleſtation.</p>
               <p>Were we aſſur'd that nothing merited our Attention, but what made Impreſſion upon our Senſes, or related to our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we ſhould then give up our ſelves to this pleaſing Lazineſs, and live, with reſpect to ſpiritual Objects, in the ſame Calm, wherein we live with regard to whatever we think can neither hurt nor benefit us. it were a Folly to part with a State full of Pleaſure, only to diſquiet our ſelves in examining what would occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Pain, but procure us no Advantage. But on the other hand, if our Negligence of thoſe things, which no way concern the Senſes, ſhould occaſion us infinitely more Harm, than our Lazineſs about them could procure us of Pleaſure; it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it were downright Madneſs for us to live in this Careleſſneſs. But we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſure our ſelves that there is nothing to be fear'd, ſhould we neglect ſpiritual things, ſuch as the Chriſtian Religion ſpeaks to us of, without examining the Reaſons upon which this Religion is
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59986:54"/>grounded; and conſequently, we muſt neceſſarily conquer this Lazineſs, that keeps us from doing it; or elſe prefer the Quiet of a Fool, grounded only upon his Stupidity, to the true Knowledg of the State wherein we are, and of what we have to fear or hope.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, thoſe who once aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelves to this Lazineſs, which hinders them from any Examination of the Principles of Religion, have the hardeſt Task in the World to reclaim themſelves; ſome of them, whereof we ſpeak nothing in this place, chuſe rather to believe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is told them of Religion, than to be at the pains of examining it; and others again will believe nothing of it, becauſe they are reſolv'd not to examine any thing of that nature. 'Tis of theſe laſt that we have undertaken to treat, and of whom it may be ſaid, that how under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſoever they ſeem'd to be before they took up this careleſs way of living, they are afterwards very difficulty brought off from it.<note place="margin">Tacit. in Agricol. c. 3.</note>

               <p>He acts plainly againſt good Senſe, who condemns what he has never well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, becauſe he had not Reſolution
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59986:55"/>enough to undergo the Trouble of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining it; and he breaks the Rules of Common Prudence who obſtinately lives in this Condition, when the Queſtion is about a Matter of ſuch great Importance as Religion. If he acted thus in relation to any other thing, that is, if he took Sides without being at the pains of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, who could he get to approve his Conduct? None ſurely; unleſs he had to do with Men void of common Senſe; ſince it cannot be deny'd, but this is viſibly expoſing himſelf to be deceiv'd, and to all the Conſequences of the Error he might fall into.</p>
               <p>Let's ſuppoſe for a moment with Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, that the Chriſtian Religion is not true, altho this cannot be known, till it be firſt examin'd; but what Risk do they run in hearing the Reaſons of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? None at all; ſince if what they affirm be not concluſive, nothing can hinder them from rejecting it. All the Loſs they can fear is only the want of a little Quiet, whereof they deprive themſelves for ſome ſmall time. But methinks a ſhort term of Careleſſneſs ought not to be of ſo great value with a Man, that nothing can be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making him quit it. Is there any in the World who can live in this eternal Indifference for all that requires Application? If any leaves this Lazineſs for other things, what Reaſon can he
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59986:55"/>bring for not quitting it in order to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his own ſtate as to Religion? If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, after taking much pains to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, a Man could not enjoy his former Quiet, he might plead very plauſibly in Defence of this Carriage; but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, after fatiguing himſelf a little, his Repoſe is but the more pleaſant. And ſo the Lazy ſhould by this Principle, at leaſt, be at the trouble of examining Religion.</p>
               <p>But now if the Chriſtian Religion be certainly true, as we maintain, a more deplorable State could not well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in this Life than that of the lazy Gentlemen we have deſcrib'd: For what can be imagin'd more lamentable, than to precipitate ones ſelf into eternal Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, rather than take the pains of learning the Means to avoid it? That Man could not be look'd upon as a lazy Perſon who would not riſe at Night for fear of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Repoſe, tho the Houſe was on fire; no, he would be taken for a Fool or a Madman.</p>
               <p>We ſee by theſe Examples very clearly, how unreaſonable that ſpiritual Lazineſs is, which keeps Men from examining Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. We perceive the dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it, or at leaſt the Miſeries that may proceed from it. Nevertheleſs there have been formerly Men of this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, and there are now even among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:59986:56"/>
               <p>Such were thoſe Jews of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 17.4.</note> whereof very few were the better for S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching, becauſe they would not examine what he ſaid; and whereof the moſt part, very zealous in all other things, rais'd a Commotion in the Town againſt the Profeſſors of Chriſtianity, as we are told by S. <hi>Luke.</hi> This appears by the Oppoſition which we find in the ſame Hiſtory, of the Jews of <hi>Berea,</hi> another City of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to thoſe of <hi>Theſſalonica. Theſe,</hi> ſays the Hiſtorian, <hi>were more noble than thoſe of</hi> Theſſalonica, <hi>in that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Word with all readineſs of mind, and ſearch'd the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe things were ſo; therefore many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi> If thoſe of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> had Love enough for the Truth to do as much, they would not have been leſs ready to receive their Reaſons who preach'd the Goſpel to 'em.

               <p>The preſent Jews who live among the Chriſtians, and perhaps a part of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometans, may neglect the Examen of Chriſtianity out of divers Principles, ſuch as thoſe we have deſcrib'd in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Chapters; but I'm very apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they mix with them a great deal of that Lazineſs we are treating of in this
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59986:56"/>Chapter. They are out of Love with all Meditation and Diſcuſſion; nor can there be a better Proof of it, than that they vouchſafe not even to examine why they give Credit to Judaiſm or Mahometaniſm. Being altogether buſy about ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and the Cares of Life, they cannot without Reluctancy think ſeriouſly and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively of any other Subject. They may be compar'd to People extremely weary after walking a great way on foot, but deſir'd to take a longer Walk to refreſh and divert themſelves. They would not hearken, be ſure, to ſuch a Propoſition, but indulging themſelves in the Pleaſure of Repoſe, they would think of no other thing except quietly enjoying their Reſt. Thus, ſuch as are buſy about the Affairs of Life, and fatigu'd with the perpetual Cares they occaſion, are lazy as to all other things.</p>
               <p>Chriſtianity being at this time divided into ſeveral Sects, whereof ſome muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be in an Error, may we not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore place in the Number of the Lazy thoſe Perſons, who, full of all other Things but the Love of the Truth, have never carefully examin'd which of theſe Sects is moſt conformable to the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Apoſtles? I own that divers other Motives might lead them to remain, without knowing why themſelves, in that Party wherein they happen'd to be born,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59986:57"/>and to condemn all others without vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing to examine their Tenets; but if you remark it well, it will appear that one of the Principles which occaſion this Conduct is a certain lazy Averſion to the Trouble of ſearching after the Truth in Matters of this kind.</p>
               <p>We may proceed yet further, ſeeing there are People who condemn not only their native Religion without having ever ſufficiently ſtudied it, but likewiſe all other Religions, tho ſtill leſs known to them: becauſe firſt perſwading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they have diſcover'd ſome Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity therein, they conclude next that all the reſt is of the ſame Nature; and ſo can never reſolve upon ſeriouſly or throughly examining the Truth. After having found out, as they think, that the ableſt Men they know teach a falſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine for a Goſpel-Truth, they judg by this Sample of the Religion of their own Country as well as of all others: and that Lazineſs which keeps 'em as it were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted, makes 'em think it more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to condemn all without any more ado, than to ingage in a ſolicitous enquiry after the true Principles of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>I have already ſhewn the Danger and Unreaſonableneſs of this Lazineſs; nor are there any Perſons who diſagree to it: but when they would actually get quit of this Paſſion, they find themſelves ſo much
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59986:57"/>prejudic'd in favour of it, that they have need of their utmoſt Endeavours to be cur'd, or to form an oppoſite Habit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all I have hitherto ſaid, we ought to reflect upon the Pleaſure of being in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Diſpoſition to this idle Temper, which is not only infinitely more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, but likewiſe much more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and it may happen that the Love of Truth would be preferr'd to a ſhameful Quiet, worthier of Beaſts than Men.</p>
               <p>Let us imagine now ſuch a lazy Perſon as we have been ſpeaking of, and let us compare his Condition to that of a Man whoſe Mind being accuſtom'd to Enquiry, finds no Repoſe except in the certain Knowledg of the Truth. The firſt having perceiv'd ſome falſe Doctrine which was taught him as a true one (for we may grant this to ſeveral of the lazy Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) he rejects this Doctrine, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe is affirm'd to be true concerning Religion, without conſidering that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truths might be mix'd with Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods in the Theology of his Country; or that there may be People perhaps elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where exempted from thoſe Errors that were taught him; or finally, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the firſt Founders of Chriſtianity might have been miſunderſtood. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe would teach a Man to ſuſpend his Judgment at leaſt, till he had exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd theſe three Heads. But for this
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59986:58"/>there is more Caution and Moderation requiſite than Unbelievers commonly have, who, looking upon ſuch an Examen to be impoſſible, chuſe rather to deny all at once. This is juſt as if any Reader, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had diſcover'd by chance an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in ſome Hiſtorian, would immediately conclude, without reading any further, that the whole was pure Romance, and that there was no ſuch thing in the World as a true Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding ſuch a ridiculous and haſty Judgment, Unbelievers ſeem to live in as profound a Tranquillity, as a Man could do who knew by Mathematical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations that all Religions were falſe. They appear to have ſo great an Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence for Truth in this reſpect, as if it did not concern them to know it. They are ready, while in this Diſpoſition, to do whatever may render the Enjoyments of Life more pleaſing, nor will they hear a word of examining; and they indulge themſelves in thoſe Pleaſures as far as they judg it poſſible without doing 'em any harm. It is plain then that this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion opens a Door to numberleſs ſecret Crimes, and gives Encouragement in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to all that can be practis'd with Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I will not inſiſt upon it, that ſuch People are bad Friends, bad Subjects, or bad Citizens, becauſe they ſacrifice every thing to their Pleaſures; I ſhall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59986:58"/>that being no way certain of the Truth of Religion, or that God would have 'em to be of any Religion, they can enjoy no other Quiet but what muſt be an Effect of the moſt notorious Folly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. They are, according to their own Judgment, every Moment in a Condition of parting for ever with what they love, and which to acquire or preſerve has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occaſion'd 'em infinite Trouble. This Loſs may happen by a thouſand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen Accidents, and at laſt it is ſure to come unavoidably by Death, beyond which they expect nothing. Nevertheleſs they live ſecurely. They behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much worſe than a Man would do, who being ſeriouſly told that he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to Death, but that there were Means of eſcaping it if he would be at the Pains to know them; and yet would think of nothing but diverting himſelf, without vouchſafing to give Attention to what was ſaid to him, tho with the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of loſing his Life, in caſe thoſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers whom he would not believe ſpoke Truth. If what Chriſtianity tells us be indeed true, there are Pains infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing Death to be fear'd by ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it; and yet Unbelievers who have no Certainty that theſe things are not true, reſt ſecurely in their Infidelity and Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ, without informing themſelves any further. In good Truth ſuch as live in this
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59986:59"/>Diſpoſition, and who imagine themſelves exalted above the Vulgar, are not in this reſpect much elevated above the Brutes, which are only concern'd about the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>Now, on the contrary, let us ſuppoſe a Man who has well ſtudy'd the Principles of true Chriſtianity, ſatisfy'd in himſelf with the Truths he has diſcover'd, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Precepts they enjoin him with all Tranquillity in this Life, and after Death he expects the Reward of his Faith, with a Contentment of Mind that cannot be equall'd. The moſt refin'd Reaſon, and the Laws of the Society wherein Men muſt neceſſarily live with one another, requires nothing of him, but he obeys it without heſitating; and whatever befals him, he looks upon Death only as a Paſſage to a much better Life than this. I dare affirm ſomething beyond all this; and it is, that ſuppoſing this Man deceiv'd, yet his Condition would be infinitely more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable than that of ſuch, as refuſing to examine Religion, reject it nevertheleſs with the Hazard of loſing themſelves for ever, and are withal in a perpetual Fear (if not quite bewitched with their Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and Lazineſs) of loſing for ever all that is dear to them.</p>
               <p>It is therefore infinitely more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and more ſure both for this and the other Life, if there be one, to ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59986:59"/>Truth, and to examine the Proofs of Religion, than to live and die in the moſt extravagant Careleſneſs imaginable. This is all that I deſire ſhould be granted me here, and that cannot be deny'd me by any, without acting againſt the cleareſt Evidence of common Senſe. Thoſe who refuſe to believe the Truth of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, ought carefully to examine themſelves, and ſee whether this Lazineſs I have deſcrib'd be not at leaſt in ſome part the Cauſe of their Incredulity. This Examination is of the utmoſt Importance, there is nothing to be loſt by making of it, and you risk all by neglecting it.</p>

               <p>I Have deſcrib'd in the preceding Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thoſe Diſpoſitions and Motives contrary to Reaſon, which might bring Unbelievers to reject the Chriſtian Religion. Altho I have conſider'd theſe different Diſpoſitions one after another, and have diſtinguiſh'd them by particular Characters, I am not of opinion however that they act ſeparately upon any, or that there are Unbelievers who may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd only with one of theſe Faults. There is not any queſtionleſs that is not at the ſame time guilty of ſeveral of them;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59986:60"/>but there are ſuch as may be more culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in one than in another. Immorality makes one an Infidel; in another 'tis Pride that chiefly oppoſes it ſelf to the Light of Truth: You ſee ſome blinded by their Prejudices which they take for undoubted Maxims; there are others who do not reaſon well, or neglect informing themſelves of what they ſhould learn, or whom Lazineſs keeps from entring upon a Diſcuſſion, which to them appears too tedious and painful. And perhaps there be thoſe in whom all theſe Faults may meet in ſome degree, tho but one of them may be their predominant Paſſion. There is likewiſe infinite Variety in Mens Genius and Underſtandings with reſpect to their good or bad Qualities, and their different Conjunctions.</p>
               <p>Did we meet with Unbelievers who could ſay, that they renounc'd the Truths of the Goſpel for no other end, but to follow the moſt conformable Principles to ſound Reaſon, and to live in a more regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner, or more uſeful to Society; and could we meet with any of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the Faults I have deſcrib'd, it might then be juſtly ſaid, that my Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of the internal Motives of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity was not ſufficient, but I take it for granted that there is not one Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, in whom ſeveral of theſe Defects are not remarkable, and I take their own
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59986:60"/>Conſciences to witneſs. They are herein to do Juſtice to themſelves: for ſuch as exhort them, as I do, get nothing by it, but only the Satisfaction of performing their Duty; nor can the Unbelievers loſe any thing by examining, if they are not in ſome of thoſe Conditions by me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd. If they are oblig'd to own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the wrong, what risk can they run by reforming? and if after a ſerious Diſcuſſion they find me deceiv'd, they'l have Reaſon to be more ſatisfy'd with their own Conduct. The Time they ſhall lay out upon this Diſquiſition cannot be counted loſt or vainly ſpent, ſeeing the Matter in Debate is the moſt important thing in the World, and that the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Truth muſt at all times neceſſarily produce Joy, Satisfaction and Tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or augment them, if enjoy'd alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>

               <hi>The Second Part.</hi> Of the Motives of Incredulity which proceed from the Occaſions given Unbelievers to doubt of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, or entirely to reject it.</head>

               <p>Altho, as I have already ſaid, there is no Unbeliever but is in ſome blameable Diſpoſition which inclines him to reject the Chriſtian Religion, it muſt be confeſs'd however that there are many other things whereof they cannot be accus'd, but which nevertheleſs confirm them in theſe Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions. 'Tis true that it is ill done of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59986:61"/>them to forſake the Truth upon any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count whatſoever, but they are not much leſs to be blam'd who furniſh 'em with the Occaſions of doing ſo. I have undertaken to ſhew the one and the other in this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Part, where, granting to Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers that many of them who profeſs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity are in the wrong in ſeveral things, I ſhall demonſtrate that it no way follows from thence that the Chriſtian Religion is not true, and that we ought not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the firſt Teachers of it, thoſe Faults which we remark at this Day in ſome of thoſe who call themſelves their Diſciples. The Occaſions which the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter give Unbelievers to conceive an ill Opinion of Religion, proceed either from the Perſons or from the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I ſhall forthwith examine thoſe which the Perſons give, and afterwards ſuch as proceed from Things.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt general and common Scandals which occaſions the Obſtinacy of Unbelievers is, that they ſee a world of People who are Chriſtians not from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Underſtanding, but from their Education, and out of mere Credulity. If theſe had been born in <hi>Aſia,</hi> they would, without changing their Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be Idolaters or Mahometans; and as zealouſly embrace the idle Dreams of the Bramins, or the Errors of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as they believe in <hi>Europe</hi> that the Chriſtian
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59986:62"/>Religion is true. They receive Fables that are manifeſtly ridiculous with no leſs Reſpect than the moſt certain Hiſtories; and they believe not leſs the moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Doctrines and the moſt contrary to the Good of Mankind, than the holieſt and moſt uſeful Precepts of the Goſpel. It is not the Nature of the Objects laid open by the Teachers of Religion to their Underſtanding, which determines theſe to believe 'em true, or to look upon them with Reſpect; but it is the Authority of thoſe who ſpeak to them well or ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded, and a certain Credulity care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully cheriſh'd in their Minds, becauſe of the Advantages drawn by ſome from it, as we ſhall ſhew in the Sequel.</p>
               <p>Deceiv'd by a faint Reſemblance, they call their <hi>Credulity</hi> by the Name of <hi>Faith,</hi> and maintain that thoſe want it who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not as they do all that is told 'em by their Preachers, and conſequently that they have not ſuch a Diſpoſition as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel requires of Men, ſeeing it promiſes Salvation only to thoſe who have <hi>Faith.</hi> If any Perſon reaſons about Religion, and ſays that it can neither be known nor prov'd without Reaſoning, preſently theſe People, who neither know the Proofs nor the Doctrines of it but very confuſedly, are ſure to ſuſpect him of Irreligion, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he forſakes any of the common Sentiments, the Falſity whereof he may
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59986:62"/>have diſcover'd by his Application and ſtudy. Theſe People ſo much perſwaded, if you believe them, of the Truth of Chriſtianity, cannot believe many times that a Man who knows how to reaſon well ſhould embrace it in good earneſt, and they are alarm'd at the leaſt Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the Unbelievers who hear theſe Diſcourſes, and behold this Conduct ſo viſibly repugnant to common Senſe, laugh at this pretended Faith, and draw from it this unhappy Conſequence, that the Doctrine to be receiv'd ſo credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly is either falſe, or at leaſt to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>Thus the Heathens formerly hearing the Chriſtians ſay, <hi>that they needed only to believe in order to be ſav'd;</hi> and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what this meant,<note n="*" place="margin">Origen. cont. Celſ. l. 1, &amp; 6.</note> laugh'd in like manner at the Chriſtian Religion, as if none could receive it but credulous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſuch as were not capable of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. And indeed if it had for a main Principle this Doctrine, <hi>That People muſt embrace it without knowing why, and that ſuch as ſhould thus believe it ſhould be ſav'd:</hi> If they had maintain'd this, I ſay, the Preachers of this Religion might be juſtly ſuſpected of Impoſture, and thoſe who receiv'd it, without being able to render any Reaſon, be condemn'd as too credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. To ſpeak in ſuch Terms would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59986:63"/>Religion with all ſorts of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, which are only eſtabliſh'd upon the Credulity of the People: It would like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe open a Door to all the Falſhoods that could be told, if Belief were all that was requiſite; for there could be no Reaſon to receive one thing without Examen no more than another. Were this ſo, how could the Chriſtians boaſt of being certain of the Truth of their Religion, and the Falſity of others; ſince the Belief of all Religions would be built upon the ſame Credulity?</p>
               <p>But 'tis falſe that the Chriſtian Religion requires Aſſent without Examination, or that it is grounded upon a blind Faith. It is alſo falſe, that ſuch as receive it upon thoſe ſcores can paſs for Chriſtians whoſe Faith is praiſe-worthy.</p>
               <p>To be certain of the firſt of theſe two things we need but conſider the Conduct and Diſcourſes of Jeſus Chriſt. Had he come into the World without any Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to diſtinguiſh him from Impoſtors who have frequently impos'd upon the Credulous; was he to be believ'd merely upon his own Word, or had he requir'd any ſuch thing, the Jews would have done well to reject him. Nay, and had he in very deed been ſent of God, if he did not offer cogent Proofs of it, no body could be blam'd for not believing on him: for then ſuch as were the moſt perſwaded of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:59986:63"/>the Truth of the Jewiſh Religion, and therefore the beſt diſpos'd to embrace the Doctrine of thoſe Prophets God would be pleas'd to ſend to them, could not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hazard of deceiving themſelves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg any Man to be effectually a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, who could give them no evident Marks of his Miſſion.</p>
               <p>Therefore Jeſus Chriſt came arm'd with the Power of working Miracles, and he wrought ſo great a Number, if you credit the Evangeliſts, that he infinitely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs'd all the Prophets who were before him. Now this is the Mark which <hi>Moſes</hi> taught the Iſraelites ſhould diſcover the true Prophets, and Jeſus Chriſt grounded himſelf upon it when he requir'd Aſſent to his Doctrine. He never deſir'd any to believe in him purely upon his Word, as it may be ſeen by divers Paſſages in the Goſpels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If I bear Witneſs of my ſelf,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Joh. 5.31.</note> 
                  <hi>my Witneſs is not true,</hi> that is, it cannot be look'd upon as true, unleſs there be ſome other Proofs of it beſides my ſaying ſo. Then, after telling that <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had bore him witneſs, he adds,<note place="margin">Ver. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>I have a greater Witneſs than that of</hi> John; <hi>for the Works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame Works that I do bear witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</hi> He further ſays to thoſe that deſir'd him to declare if he were the Chriſt, <hi>The Works that I do in my

                  <hi>but if I do, tho you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not me, believe the Works.</hi> What can be ſaid more to the purpoſe than what you meet with in the ſame Goſpel, <hi>viz. If I had not done amongst 'em the Works which none other Man did,</hi>

                  <hi>they had not had Sin?</hi> By this it appears clearly that the Author of the Chriſtian Religion did not require Aſſent to his bare Word.</p>
               <p>His Apoſtles have acted juſt after the ſame manner; for they did not only af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that they had ſeen the Miracles of their Maſter, or that he had ſpoken to them from Heaven after his Aſcenſion; but they have alſo join'd to their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all the Marks of Truth that could be poſſibly defir'd. Their Doctrine conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in it ſelf did not afford the leaſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſuſpect Impoſture; they could not expect any temporal Advantage by publiſhing it; on the contrary they met every where with an obſtinate Reſiſtance from the Jews and Heathens; they were ill us'd every Moment, and walk'd in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Dangers: In a word, many of 'em ſuffer'd Death for conſtantly perſevering in the Profeſſion of the Truth. And to accumulate Proofs, they wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles like to thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt, as he promis'd them they ſhould before he left them. The Incredulous will object per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59986:64"/>that I beg the Queſtion by ſuppoſing the Truth of what is doubted of; but my Deſign is not now to infer any Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from theſe Facts in favour of the Chriſtian Religion: I only conclude from hence that the Apoſtles did not preach a blind Faith or Obedience, as ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do at this time: One of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts thoſe to whom he writes, <hi>not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve every Spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John. 4.1.</note> 
                  <hi>but to try the Spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of God, becauſe may falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were gone out into the World.</hi> Another adviſes them, <hi>to try all things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.21.</note> 
                  <hi>and to hold faſt that which is beſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It cannot be ſaid therefore that ſuch as cry up implicite Faith do act according to the Genius of Chriſtianity; nor can the ridiculous Pretences of thoſe who require Aſſent to their ſay-ſo, be juſtly attributed to Jeſus Chriſt or his Apoſtles. It may be demanded of me here perhaps, what that <hi>Faith</hi> is which is ſo much commended in the Writings of Chriſt's Diſciples. This is not the proper Place of diſcuſſing this Subject throughtly, nor will I meddle with any more of it than is abſolutely neceſſary to ſolve this Difficulty. <hi>Faith,</hi> as we have ſaid before, being not an implicite Belief, conſiſts firſt in aſſenting to good Proofs, that is, as ſtrong Proofs as the Nature of the thing will bear. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, A Man affirms himſelf to be ſent of God, he preaches a certain Doctrine
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59986:65"/>to me, which he confirms by Miracles. Immediately I examine this Doctrine in it ſelf, without regard to any Prejudices, and without conſidering whether it be conformable to my preſent Diſpoſition or not; and if I find that it contains nothing falſe, I conclude it may poſſibly come from God. Then I proceed to the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and if I ſee 'em wrought, or if I find the Truth of them atteſted by Perſons worthy of Credit, I cannot doubt but God has actually ſent this Man.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are capable of making this Examen as they ought, are worthy of great Praiſe; for in the firſt place they muſt quit all their Prejudices, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what is propos'd to them, not as it relates to themſelves, but with reſpect to the eternal Laws of Truth and Falſhood. Secondly, they muſt have a great Love for the Truth to go through with an Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, whoſe Conſequences may prove very oppoſite to their temporal Intereſts, as I have ſhewn in the firſt Part of this Work. There are Times and Places when a Man cannot declare himſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the Truth of the Goſpel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expoſing himſelf to moſt cruel Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions; and it may be ſaid, that the Commands of Chriſt cannot be exactly obſerved by us any where almoſt, without drawing upon our ſelves the Hatred and Contempt of ſuch as diſobey them, that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59986:65"/>is, of the greateſt Part of Men. So that to be a good Chriſtian, there is more Courage and Reſolution neceſſary than is commonly imagin'd; nor can it therefore be doubted, but that Faith, ſuch as the Goſpel requires of us, is a very great Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
               <p>It is alſo deſerving of much Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, if we conſider that it is never found but in Minds well-diſpos'd. It en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages us not only to believe that he who ſpeaks to us in the Name of God, and adds ſufficient Proofs of it, has been really ſo ſent, but alſo to expect great things of God for the future, grounding our ſelves upon the Proofs he exhibits of his Power. Thoſe who ſaw the Perſons brought to Life again by Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after his Reſurrection, and who could not doubt of the Truth of theſe Miracles, were oblig'd from hence to a firm Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of what he taught them concerning the general Reſurrection of all Men. I'm of opinion that no reaſonable Man will look upon the laſt as impoſſible, if he holds the firſt to be true; for there is no greater Difficulty in raiſing an hundred than one again: and it could not, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Folly, be ſaid by any, that God's Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was all ſpent upon thoſe firſt Effects of it they had ſeen. Nevertheleſs, Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accuſtom'd to believe nothing but what they learn from their own Experience, can
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59986:66"/>ſcarcely be perſwaded of any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing ſome Examples of it. He muſt be a Perſon of Diſcernment and good Senſe who draws ſuch a Conſequence as I have mention'd; and he muſt alſo have ſome Equity, to expect for the future ſuch great things from the Marks that God has given of his Power. An unjuſt and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Man will believe nothing except what he ſees, and has no regard to any thing but the preſent.</p>
               <p>It cannot be deny'd therefore, but that ſuch an enlightn'd and underſtanding Faith as we have deſcrib'd, is a moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Diſpoſition of Mind, and moſt agreeable to the pureſt Light of Reaſon. But here I foreſee an Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> I ſhall be told that I have deſcrib'd the Faith of ſuch as had ſeen the Miracles of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and not their Faith who live at this time. To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that what I have ſaid of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of ſuch as have ſeen thoſe Miracles, may be eaſily apply'd to them that now will examine the Proofs we have that ſuch Miracles were really perform'd. To aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to theſe Proofs one muſt be in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition like to theirs who firſt embrac'd Chriſtianity, by ſeeing the Micracles of its Founders. Nay, in ſome ſenſe it may be ſaid, that ſuch as reliſh thoſe Proofs, and draw from them their natural Conſequences, ought to be better diſpos'd than thoſe who
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59986:66"/>were the Eye-witneſſes of the Actions of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; becauſe what is ſeen makes an Impreſſion upon the moſt ignorant Perſons; whereas abſtracted Proofs require more Penetration and Love of Truth than moſt Men have. This is the Reaſon that Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaking to St. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 20.29.</note> who without he ſaw him would not believe his Reſurrection, ſays to him, <hi>Thomas, becauſe thou haſt ſeen me thou believeſt; Bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have believed.</hi> He accus'd him of Obſtinacy, becauſe having no juſt Occaſion of ſuſpecting any Faud in the other Apoſtles who affirm'd they had ſeen their Maſter, yet he would not believe them. If this Diſpoſition be blameable, as indeed it is, we muſt on the other hand commend their Diſpoſition, who, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing, aſſent to ſufficient Reaſons. St. <hi>Peter</hi> therefore praiſes thoſe Chriſtians to whom he wrote, becauſe <hi>they loved Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt whom they had not ſeen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believed in him, tho then they ſaw him not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It will be eaſily granted perhaps that Docility, the contrary Diſpoſition to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, is very praiſe-worthy; but it may be ſaid to me, that the knowing Faith which proceeds from it, muſt be a very rare thing, compar'd to the blind Faith I condemn. It is well known that there are few Men of all Qualities and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59986:67"/>fit to examine throughly ſuch Proofs as our Belief is built upon, and that do not judg of the Cauſe before underſtanding it. From thence it muſt follow, ſome will ſay, that you deny to a great many thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations which you beſtow upon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faith. The moſt ſimple, and theſe are ſuch as were thought fitteſt to receive the Goſpel, are not capable to examine their Proofs, and ſo excluded, according to you, from the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Theſe Difficulties, I confeſs, appear ſpecious at firſt ſight, but at bottom have no Solidity. <hi>Firſt;</hi> I agree that true Faith is a thing infinitely more rare than Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or Infidelity, and herein I do but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Doctrine of the Goſpel, which ſays,<note place="margin">Mat. 20.16 &amp; 17.14.</note> 
                  <hi>that many are called but few choſen.</hi> That Vertue which the Goſpel requires of Men is not a thing commonly met with, no more than extraordinary Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. Nor ought the Incredulous to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Deſcription I have made of the true Faith agrees but to very few Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. On the contrary, we might ſuſpect the Sincerity of the firſt Teachers of Chriſtianity, had they taught a Doctrine fit to draw in a great Multitude without Knowledg or Vertue, promiſing them Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation notwithſtanding their Ignorance and Vices. It would have been ſaid not without Reaſon, that they only deſign'd to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59986:67"/>gain the Multitude, and to augment the Number of their Followers. But the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Chriſtian Religion has ſaid, <hi>that ſtrait is the Gate</hi> of Salvation,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.14.</note> 
                  <hi>and that they are few who enter it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly;</hi> The Simple, or the Babes whom the Goſpel commends, are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or ſtupid Men, who have no Reliſh of Truth. They are not ſelf-conceited Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they are troubl'd with few Prejudices, and are ready to embrace Truth and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue when offer'd or taught them. On the contrary, the wiſe and prudent, who are not fit to receive the Goſpel, are Men puft up with pretended Knowledg, full of Prejudices, and ſo diſpos'd as to reject whatever is not conformable to their Ideas, and their preſent Condition. Such were the Prieſts and Scribes of the Jews, and moſt of the beſt Quality of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They were ſo ſtrongly perſwaded that there could not be imagin'd a better way of ſerving God than that there was no Theology more excellent than their own; that to offer at undeceiving them was enough to procure their Hatred and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Moreover, they were not Perſons who knew how to reaſon ſtrictly, or that had exact Ideas of Theology and Morals. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> explain'd by their Teachers, and their Traditions good or bad, made up all their Knowledg.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59986:68"/>Jeſus Chriſt calls 'em Wiſe and Prudent, only becauſe they were commonly thought ſo. On the other hand, ſuch as he calls Babes, were People look'd upon by the Doctors of the Law as Children in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Learned; but that indeed were much more capable of reliſhing Truth than they, becauſe they were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther blinded with Prejudices, nor fill'd with a high Conceit of themſelves. They were alſo Men of good Senſe, very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judges of the Truth of Chriſt's Miracles, and the Sanctity of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>Something of this nature may be met with every Day in thoſe Places where Theology is corrupted by the Errors that are mix'd with it. Let any addreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to an unlearned Perſon, but of good Senſe and Morals, he can be eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that the Divinity of his Country is erroneous: He ſhall very well perceive the Force of a good Argument, and yields Aſſent to Truth as ſoon as he knows it. Go on the contrary, and propoſe the ſame thing to a Divine, there is no wrangling Shifts nor Chichaneries that he has not recourſe to, rather than acknowledg the Truth; and his pretended Learning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes often to render the cleareſt Truths obſcure to him. In the mean time, if you would repreſent to him the Example of one amongſt the Vulgar, who
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59986:68"/>had been convinc'd by your Reaſons, he would treat him immediately as an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant or fickle Fellow, altho he had much more Senſe and Integrity than himſelf. This is what Jeſus Chriſt remark'd when he ſaid, <hi>I thank thee, O Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 12.25.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe thou haſt hidden theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and haſt reveal'd them unto Babes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſome will preſs upon me harder, it may be, and ask what I think of that great Number of People, who not only have no ſort of Learning, but that cannot conceive an Argument of two Lines, that underſtand not the Proofs of Chriſtianity, that conſequently are not capable of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them, and that nevertheleſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Altho an infinite Number of People be comprehended under the Name of rude and ignorant Perſons, we muſt however acknowledg that there are ſeveral Degrees and Sorts of Ignorance. They cannot be all exactly diſtinguiſh'd, but this is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to anſwer the Queſtion propos'd. I ſhall remark in the firſt place, that thoſe rude and ignorant Perſons who are Men of ill Morals, and continue ſuch, are not of their Number whoſe Faith is acceptable to God, tho they make Profeſſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Jeſus Chriſt. He will make no more account of 'em for this, than if they had been in a quite oppoſite Perſwaſion; and 'tis certain that no Ignorance can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59986:69"/>them, as we could eaſily ſhew. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if Men not of ſuch ill Morals, at leaſt not in ſo ſcandalous a manner, ſhould embrace the Goſpel out of pure Creduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as they would receive the contrary were they taught it, 'tis evident this is not the Faith ſo much extoll'd by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. A Proof whereof is, that thoſe People ordinarily change from black to white, according as they alter their Minds who have the Conduct of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. Nor do I well know whether ſuch Men can be properly ſaid to be of any Opinion: for they have no Conception of what is never ſo little abſtracted, and only conform themſelves externally to thoſe for whom they have a Reſpect.</p>
               <p>But among thoſe that may be term'd groſs and ignorant Perſons, there are ſome who, without any Learning, have much Uprightneſs and Integrity of Mind, which makes them admire and receive the Truths of the Goſpel as ſoon as propos'd to them, tho they are not always capable to expreſs clearly all that they think. The Beauty of the Evangelick Morals makes a great Impreſſion upon ſuch Men, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gains their Souls; and as they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver nothing in the other Doctrines of Chriſtianity that ſhocks their Notions or Deſires, they cordially embrace them, and conſtantly perſevere to believe them. This Diſpoſition and Carriage is certainly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59986:69"/>very commendable, and conformable to the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. Such were, for example, the Apoſtles, before they were extraordinarily illuminated. The Miracles and Diſcourſes of Jeſus Chriſt gain'd them in a ſmall time; and the more they continu'd with him, the more they admir'd him, altho they were ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd with ſome Jewiſh Errors.</p>
               <p>We may place alſo in this Rank the Publicans and Women of ill Lives, who were converted by ſeeing the Miracles and hearing the Doctrine of Chriſt. There are a world of People of this ſort, who are for a time drawn into an evil and ſhameful manner of Life by ſeducing Temptations, and the Force of certain Conjunctures; but all the while the Love of Truth and Vertue is not quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd in them. And this is the Reaſon that when Providence lays the one or the other before them in a ſenſible and touching way, as in the time of Jeſus Chriſt, and upon a thouſand other Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they forthwith renounce their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities, and zealouſly take up the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Method of Living.</p>
               <p>At this Day ſuch as truly believe in Chriſt, and that are not capable of making long Deductions, have not indeed the ſame Advantages as the Apoſtles had, and the other Diſciples, who ſaw thoſe Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought which convinc'd them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59986:70"/>much reaſoning, of the Truth of his Miſſion, and the Divinity of his Doctrine. But the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, the Holineſs of its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts recommends them as much as ever to the underſtanding of ſuch as are not quite corrupted with the bad Cuſtoms of the Age. We ſee every day the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Uſefulneſs of them, whether we conſider them as practis'd by others, or remark the Diſorders which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all ways of living oppoſite to them. To perceive this, there is need only of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Vertue and good Senſe. On the other hand, if we caſt our Eye upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines contain'd in the Goſpel, and which ſolely tend to lead us to the Obſervation of its Precepts, to procure us eternal Happineſs, there is nothing herein but what is worthy of God, eſpecially if they be drawn out of thoſe Fountains which the Subtlety of Modern Divines has not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Nor does the Hiſtory of the firſt Eſtabliſhment of the Goſpel contain any thing but what is conformable to the Doctrine of it, and proper to perſwade us of its Truth. This Hiſtory written in ſo plain and natural a Method, carries in it ſelf all the Characters of Sincerity; inſomuch that in reading of it, one has not the leaſt Suſpicion to make him doubt, whether the Writers of it believ'd it or not. The moſt part of the Matters of
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:59986:70"/>Fact mention'd in it are of ſuch a Nature that few could be deceiv'd about them. All this join'd together is more than ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to perſwade a Man whom Vice, or I know not what Science falſly ſo call'd, hath not blinded: and the Difficulties which the Incredulous find in them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed rather from their Diſpoſition of Mind than from the things themſelves.</p>
               <p>It is indeed true that the Perſons we ſpeak of are not capable to judg of thoſe ſubtle and perplex'd Queſtions which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Divines. But it cannot be ſaid neither, that the diſtinct Belief of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines above the reach of a diſcreet and ſincere Man that loves Vertue, tho he has no Learning; it cannot be affirm'd, I ſay, that ſuch a diſtinct Belief is neceſſary to his Salvation. Every Man that loves the Truth, that according to his beſt Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding embraces all that he conceives in the Goſpel, that orders his Life by what he believes, and that endeavours as much as poſſible he can to encreaſe his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, does all that is requiſite to obtain Salvation from the Mercy of God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ideas we have of it from the Goſpel. For it may be ſaid. that this Man improves the Talents he receiv'd as much as God indiſpenſibly requires it of him; and nothing hinders, but we may apply to him what Jeſus Chriſt ſaid in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; <hi>Good and faithful Servant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 25.23.</note> 
                  <hi>thou hast
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59986:71"/>been faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over many things: enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be objected to me further, that there are ſome who are not by any means capable to ſee in the Morals of the Goſpel, in its other Doctrines, and in the Hiſtory of it, that Uſefulneſs, Excellence and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity which I ſaid might be remark'd therein, and nevertheleſs believe it to be true; I have nothing to reply to this but what I have ſaid already. Theſe People imitate others, but they have not that Faith which the Goſpel demands. It is not calculated indeed for the Learned alone, but no more is it for Brutes. Such as underſtand not, or are ſuppos'd not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to underſtand any thing of it, ſhould become Men before they think of being Chriſtians; for there is no great Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between them and the Savages of <hi>Africa</hi> or <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I may conclude that the Incredulous do calumniate the Chriſtian Religion when they accuſe it of requiring from Men a blind Credulity, and to condemn Examination. It has been ſhewn that there is nothing more falſe, by Reaſons, if I'm not miſtaken, that can never be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That the Immorality or Ignorance of thoſe who ſometimes ſhew the greateſt Zeal for Religion, ought not to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it ſuſpected to the Incredulous.</head>
               <p>THE Chriſtian Religion demanded not only that it ſhould be thought true, but alſo that this Belief be externally profeſs'd, and that a Man let no Opportunity ſlip of ſhewing others by his Life and Diſcourſe that he's firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of it. 'Tis by no means a ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Science to continue lock'd up in the Memory, without bearing any Fruit out of it, and without appearing in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Living who are convinc'd of its Truth. It fills them with a certain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour for the Obſervation of what it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, that the true Chriſtians are eaſily perceiv'd to be in earneſt. 'Tis this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that is call'd <hi>Zeal</hi> from a Greek Word which ſignifies <hi>Jealouſy,</hi> to ſhew that we ought not to have leſs Ardour for the Honour of Chriſtianity than a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſhould be concern'd to preſerve that of his Bride.</p>
               <p>This Zeal extends generally to all the Doctrines, and to all the Precepts of the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59986:72"/>Goſpel, and not to ſome of them only. We ought zealouſly to defend the Truths we learn from it, otherwiſe it were to betray and equal it to Falſhood; nor ought we to manifeſt leſs Ardour in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving its Injunctions, ſeeing this is not leſs eſſential than the Belief of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. The one and the other muſt be joined; for Chriſtianity is entirely ruin'd, if thoſe things be ſeparated which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it has united. The Reaſon of this is, that the Doctrines lead us to the Obſervation of the Precepts, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd to us for this end; and the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Precepts does indiſpenſibly ſuppoſe a ſtrong Perſwaſion of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>
               <p>All Chriſtians are agreed about this Principle, and Jeſus Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles are very expreſs about it, ſo that there is no neceſſity to prove it. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, it is evident that ſuch as ſhew the greateſt Zeal for the Chriſtian Doctrines, and for the way of explaining them in their Country, are frequently ſeen to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the cleareſt Precepts of it after a moſt ſcandalous manner, as if this Ardour they ſhew for the Defence of the Doctrines were all that the Goſpel requires of Men.</p>
               <p>There are ſome People, for inſtance, whoſe Diſcourſes breathe nothing elſe, one would think, but the Love of the Truth, and the Deſire of preſerving the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59986:72"/>of it, and of propagating it amongſt Men. They write in favour of it, they defend it with much heat againſt oppoſite Errors, and they ſtick at no difficulty to make Truth triumph over Falſhood. Nay, they expoſe themſelves ſometimes to Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers for this with a ſurprizing Courage. But theſe very ſame People who ſeem en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to the Service of God, and the Defence of Religion, are ſometimes altogether intractable, when a Man has any Dealings with them. Selfiſh, proud, deceitful, Slanderers, uncharitable, and breaking moſt of the Commandments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding their Neighbour, they imagine themſelves the beſt Chriſtians in the World; and the ignorant or corrupt Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude looks upon 'em as in effect good Men. Such were in Chriſt's time the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, whoſe Zeal for the Law we read of in the Goſpel, where at the ſame time they are repreſented as a very ill ſort of Men. There are too many ſuch at this time, and every Country will furniſh fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Examples to all that have a mind to make their Obſervations. What St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid long ago to the hypocritical Jews, may be now ſaid to many People; <hi>You that make your boast of the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.23</note> 
                  <hi>by breaking the Law, diſhonour God; for the Name of God is blaſphem'd among the Gentiles through you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Unbelievers who take notice of theſe Men, draw a Conſequence very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59986:73"/>to the Chriſtian Religion; which is, that ſeeing thoſe who paſs for the Pillars of Religion, who have ſometimes the beſt Employments, and who are in moſt Eſteem, are ſuch ill People, the Religion it ſelf is but a mere Artifice to deceive the Simple, and to cover their Paſſions under a Pretence which gains 'em Reſpect: For in a word, all that the Zealous do, if you believe 'em, is for no other end but the Service of God. Thus Unbelievers come to imagine that the Beauty of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Morals, which they cannot deny, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a fine Idea to impoſe the more eaſily up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as are not always upon their Guard. They are much talk'd of, ſay they, but the moſt Zealous obſerve no more of them than ſerves their turn. They would have others, perhaps, obey them exactly, that they might get by it, but as for themſelves they laugh at them. You'l hear thoſe, for example, preach Charity and Impartiality, who have neither the one nor the other, but are wonderfully pleas'd to find thoſe they have to do with not ſelfiſh or uncharitable, becauſe it makes for their Advantage.</p>
               <p>This is what Unbelievers ſay, and they are never unfurniſh'd with Examples to cite about all the Chriſtian Vertues, whereof there is not one that has not been violated by ſome Zealot, and many times without doing him any Injury in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59986:73"/>of the World, becauſe this Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Zeal covers all Defects.</p>
               <p>The Fact we deny not, and we may add further, that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles have foreſeen it, by exalting that Charity which is principally violated by this falſe Zeal, above not only Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, but even the higheſt Knowledg, and the Power of working Miracles it ſelf. Not every one that cries unto me, <hi>Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.21.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord,</hi> ſays Jeſus Chriſt, that is, who makes Profeſſion of the Truth of my Doctrine, <hi>ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: but he that doth the Will of my Father which is in Heaven. Many will ſay to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name? and in thy Name have cast out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils? and in thy Name have done many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Works? And then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you; depart from me you that work Iniquity.</hi> This is a manifeſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition which the Author of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion gives to his Diſciples, to prevent the evil Example of pretended Zealots making any Impreſſion upon them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe expreſſes himſelf upon this occaſion in ſuch emphatical terms, that it was not poſſible for him to ſpeak more home: <hi>Tho I ſpeak,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.1</note> 
                  <hi>with the Tongues of Men and Angels, and have not Charity, I'm become as a ſounding Braſs, or a tinkling Cymbal. And tho I have the Gift of Prophecy, and underſtand all Myſteries,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59986:74"/>and all Knowledg: and tho I have all Faith, ſo that I could remove Mountains, and have no Charity, I am nothing. And tho I beſtow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and tho I give my Body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appears plainly hereby that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of pretended Zealots is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Principles of the Goſpel, as I have ſhewn from the beginning of this Chapter. This may ſerve for an Anſwer to Unbelievers, who cannot, without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, confound ſome Perſons Abuſe of Religion with Religion it ſelf. If any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have very much ſtudy'd a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Science, and that it appear'd by ſome of his Diſcourſes that he underſtood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, could it be concluded from thence that this Science was only a Chime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra? No body durſt maintain it. But 'tis juſt thus with the Chriſtian Religion, and ſuch as are carry'd away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with a falſe Zeal.</p>
               <p>The Incredulous object further, that ſince thoſe who ſhew the greateſt Zeal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not the moſt important Precepts of this Religion, 'tis at leaſt a ſign that they are not themſelves perſwaded of its Truth; for otherwiſe, ſay they, they would not quit the beſt part of it, ſeeing, if the ſpeculative Doctrines be true, what concerns Practice is not leſs ſo. But if the moſt zealous are not perſwaded of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59986:74"/>their Religion, what may be judg'd of its Proofs?</p>
               <p>This is certainly a Prejudice that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficultly conquer'd in the Minds of thoſe who have more regard to what is ſaid than to what is done, and who look upon Mens Morals as the Character of their Belief. Every Perſon has not ſtrength of Thought enough to conſider the Laws of the Goſpel in themſelves, without any reſpect to the manner how they are obey'd, or to the Judgment that Chriſtians ſeem to make of them by their Conduct. But at bottom this is an ill-grounded Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, from which no Conſequence can be inferr'd againſt the Truth of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, as it will appear by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Remarks.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, we may grant that there are ſome of thoſe Zealots in ſhew for a part of the Chriſtian Doctrines, who are not in effect perſwaded of any of them, and who make uſe of the Cloak of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to impoſe upon the Multitude, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to carry on their Affairs in the World. But does it follow from hence that the Chriſtian Religion is not true? By no means; ſince it is evident that theſe Men may be deceiv'd as well as others. They are not always ſuch as make the greateſt Noiſe about an Art that beſt underſtand it. And if all the Diſcourſes of theſe People were well examin'd, it might be
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59986:75"/>eaſily perceiv'd that the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has Beauties to which they are utter Strangers. There might be alſo remark<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in their Diſpoſitions ſome invincible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles to the ſincere Acknowledgment of the Truth of Chriſtianity, which is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely contrary to thoſe Diſpoſitions. The greateſt part of theſe People believe, for example, that Force muſt be made uſe of to eſtabliſh Truth, and that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates who favour them ought to uſe thoſe hardly that are not of their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Nay, they maintain, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Chriſtianity is loſt, and that all other Religions ſhall triumph over it. All had been ſtill Pagan, according to them, if <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and the other ſucceeding Chriſtian Emperors had not employ'd their Authority to deſtroy Heatheniſm. Now what other thing can ſuch Diſcourſes mean, but that they are Strangers to the true Proofs of Chriſtianity, as well as to the Spirit of Charity and Moderation, which is the Life and Soul of the Goſpel? Thoſe who have well ſtudy<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d theſe Proofs, and carefully examin'd all the Parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Chriſtian Religion is made up, find it ſo well grounded, its Promiſes ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming God and Men, and its Precepts ſo uſeful to humane Society, that to make it wholly triumph over Error, it is enough in their Judgment to obtain a Liberty of preaching it, and that ſuch as profeſs it
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59986:75"/>may incur no Danger for ſo doing; in a word, that it may oppoſe the contrary Opinions with equal Arms. Theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons animated with that Spirit of Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof I ſpoke, and equally preſſing all the Parts of Chriſtianity, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict by their Actions the Doctrines they profeſs with their Mouths. If Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion therefore were to be judg'd of from the Conduct and Diſcourſes of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, regard ought to be had rather to theſe Men than to others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I have ſhew'd elſewhere that ſince Men do not always act according to their Knowledg, but moſt frequently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Movements of their Paſſions, their Sentiments muſt not be always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from their Carriage. This being ſo, it may probably happen that certain Zealots might act very diſagreeably to their Profeſſion, which is an Argument that we ought not to judg of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion from their Manners. We muſt confeſs however, that if in thoſe Zealots there appears a continual Series of Actions contrary to the cleareſt Commands of the Goſpel, or inveterate Habits of walking contrary to what muſt be known to be an eſſential part of Chriſtianity, then we have great occaſion to ſuſpect them of Hypocriſy, and a Deſign of covering their Infidelity with a ſhew of Zeal. For it is not poſſible but that a ſtrong and ſincere
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59986:76"/>Belief ſhould at length eradicate out of the Heart all Habits which are directly contrary to it. But the moſt ingenuous Men may act ſometimes againſt their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion by Surprize, or the ſudden Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a violent Paſſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, As it would be Injuſtice to judg of the Goodneſs of the Laws of any Government from the way how they are obſerv'd, ſo it would be very ill reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to condemn the Chriſtian Religion, becauſe ſuch as profeſs it obey it not. There may be moſt excellent Laws, and acknowledg'd too for ſuch, yet not always ſtrictly obſerv'd, by reaſon of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and Paſſions of thoſe who break 'em, as it may be remark'd in all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms of the World. 'Tis juſt ſo with the Chriſtian Religion. What cauſes this Contradiction between the Sentiments and Carriage of Men, beſides the Reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready alledg'd, is perhaps becauſe they know not how to apply the general Laws to the particular Caſes which happen eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and that they miſtake the moſt prohibited Actions for Exceptions to the Rules.<note place="margin">Arrian <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> Epicte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, l. 3. c. 26.</note> A famous Philoſopher ſaid, <hi>that moſt of Mens Errors proceeded from their not knowing how to apply general to particular Ideas.</hi> If we conſider it nearly, we ſhall find that the ſame thing occaſions at leaſt in part the violation of many Laws, which are all the while thought juſt and well-grounded.</p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:59986:76"/>
               <p>Zeal accompany'd with very great Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and the greater as the Ignorance is groſſer, furniſhes the Incredulous like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with another Pretence of looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Religion as a blind Perſwaſion merely built upon the Credulity of the People. And indeed we ſee that in all Religions ſuch as have leaſt examin'd things, and that are the leſs diſcerning, appear fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the hotteſt in defence of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with which they are engag'd. The furious Zeal of the Jews and Mahumetans, as well as that of the Pagan Populace, is ſo well known, that I need bring no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of it. In thoſe Sects alſo into which Chriſtianity is at preſent divided, the Heat wherewith the ignorant Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude defend their Sentiments, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to propagate them, is but too common. This blind Zeal has ſo often broke out, and has made uſe of ſuch ill Methods to advance each Party, that there is no Sect but has ſome reaſon to be aſham'd of it.</p>
               <p>But if this falſe Zeal may be conſider'd as a Conſequence of the Principles of the Heathens, the Mahumetans, the Jews, and ſome of the Chriſtians; it is certain that true Chriſtianity gives it no Approbation: ſo that if the Falſity of theſe Religions or Sects may be hence concluded, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not that we can reaſon againſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in the ſame manner. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewn in the precedent Chapter
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59986:77"/>that it requires no ſuch thing as a blind Obedience from ſuch as embrace it, and that it expreſly condemns the furious Zeal which flows from this Spring. One of Chriſt's Apoſtles acknowledging that the Jews had <hi>a Zeal for God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.2 Gal. 1.14.</note> adds, that it was without Knowledg, and blames it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. Another ſays to thoſe to whom he writes;<note place="margin">Jam. 3.14.</note> 
                  <hi>If you have bitter Zeal and Strife in your Hearts, glory not, and lie not against the Truth: This Wiſdom deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh: for where this Zeal and Strife is, there is Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and every evil Work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This blind Zeal then is not an Effect of the Chriſtian Religion, and cannot be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably attributed to it; it is a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Temper and Education of the ignorant Populace, who inſtead of defending the Truth by its proper Light, and the Vertues it does produce in their Hearts who duly receive it, defend it with the ſame Arms they would Error, that is, with Paſſion and Fury. This ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cannot, without extreme Injuſtice, be look'd upon as Models whereby to judg of the Spirit and Effects of Chriſtianity, ſince it clearly condemns their Conduct. We muſt on the contrary caſt our Eye upon the underſtanding Perſons who make uſe of none but good Reaſons in its Defence; and that, to procure themſelves Love and Reſpect, practiſe only thoſe calm and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59986:77"/>peaceable Vertues they learn from Truth. This is the Character which the Founders of Chriſtianity beſtow upon them who ought to be conſider'd as the true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. <hi>The Wiſdom that is from above,</hi> ſays the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>is first pure, then peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality, and without Hypocriſy.</hi>

               <p>SInce Chriſtianity has flouriſh'd in the World, it has frequently prov'd an advantagious thing to ſhew great Zeal for the Doctrines of it. Altho this makes no Change in the thing it ſelf, (Truth not depending upon the Intereſt one has or has not to defend it) yet the Incredulous are ſure to take an occaſion from hence of doubting the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. There are Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours made ſometimes to gain them over, by repreſenting to them the Conſent of the Clergy in ſo many Places and Ages: but they inſtantly reply, that 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:59986:78"/>if thoſe Men did make a Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, ſince they would be great getters by it in ſo doing, but muſt loſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely if they did not.</p>
               <p>And indeed we muſt confeſs, that no cogent Concluſion can be drawn from the Example of all ſuch as have defended, or that now defend the Chriſtian Religion againſt Infidels. But their Reaſoning is ſtill leſs ſolid, as I ſhall ſhew after putting it in a greater Light. It is not well done to give thoſe Occaſions of ſaying, that the Defenders of the Chriſtian Religion di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the Force of their Objections; and thoſe who by their ill Carriage put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them this Stone of Offence and Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, deſerve to be reproached for it, not to ſpeak of revenging in this place the Wrong they do to Chriſtianity. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I have from the very beginning of this Work propos'd to my ſelf not only to deal with ſuch as entirely reject it, but with thoſe alſo who ſeem to embrace it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by halves.</p>
               <p>Let us imagine then a cheating Prieſt, (People but too much known in all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom</hi>) who pretends to ſome Benefice, if he has none already, or aſpires to a greater Dignity than what he poſſeſſes. He appears humble, gentle, moderate, and kind. He ſpeaks of nothing but Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs, and the Vanity of all the Enjoyments of this Life. If he has a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59986:78"/>for the Pulpit, he there principally ſhews his Zeal againſt the corrupt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Times. Nay, he's in a Fury againſt ſcandalous Clergy-men, and the Abuſes committed in Eccleſiaſtical Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſo long complain'd of, and not yet reform'd. In a word, he uſes all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes that ſhould be made in that Place, in order to paſs for an honeſt Man, and to make the World believe, that had his Incomes been greater, he would put 'em to much better Uſes than moſt Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks do.</p>
               <p>After acting his Part for ſome Years, at laſt he obtains his end, that is, a Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Income that render him conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the World and in the Church. But then it may be ſaid of him, <hi>Quantum mutatus ab illo?</hi> for indeed he's no longer to be known. He's forthwith haughty, hard-hearted, untractable, and paſſionate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all ſuch as he thinks his Inferiours. Thoſe who were his Friends before, and upon whoſe Friendſhip too he valu'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ought to be very well ſatisfy'd with him, if he now vouchſafes them a Look. The Obligations they laid upon him, while he continu'd a private Perſon, and when they expected no Returns from him, are quite loſt. He thinks they were all due to his Merit, and that more were owing him; but as for himſelf, he owes nothing to any body, and does 'em too
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59986:79"/>much Honour, when he coldly receives the Incenſe they are baſe enough to offer him. If he prefers any Man, he muſt be ſome Blockhead or Flatterer, People that have no Idea almoſt of their Duty, and that are ready to admire any thing, the Bad as well as the Good, ſo be you make 'em live at their Eaſe.</p>
               <p>This Man ſo diſintereſted heretofore, becomes oftentimes inſatiable, and the Revenues of the beſt Benefices are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſatisfy his Avarice. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures therefore as many as he can, and has never too many. If he be naturally covetous, all that he preach'd before of Liberality is quite vaniſh'd, all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectives he made againſt Avarice are laid in perpetual Oblivion. He does Good to no body, and thinks of nothing but laying up Treaſure. If on the contrary he be a voluptuous or ſtately Perſon, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes his great Incomes in keeping a mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Table, in having a ſtately Train, and living as the proudeſt Men, or the moſt addicted to their Pleaſure in the World. The ſordid Avarice of the one is a Frugality becoming a good Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and the exceſſive Luxury of the other is but an Expence abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to keep up his Rank in the World, and to beget Reſpect in the Laity. Far from making the leaſt Reformation in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy that depend upon them, they let them
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59986:79"/>looſe to all the ill Cuſtoms and Manners to which they are ſubject, on condition they be ſubmiſſive to them, and meddle not with their particular Method of living.</p>
               <p>When Unbelievers conſider ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, they cannot help being perſwaded that theſe Prelates, even before they get thoſe Dignities which they ſo ſcandalouſly abuſe, did not believe a word of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They imagine that they were not devoted to the Church to edify it, and to lead Chriſtians to a vertuous Life by their Diſcourſes and their Example, but out of Ambition or Avarice; and that they made uſe of the Cloak of Religion to come at their ends. They likewiſe draw hence a further Conſequence, which is, that the Chriſtian Religion is not true in it ſelf, ſince Men of the firſt Order, and that make a Profeſſion of defending it, believe it not, whatever they ſay by reaſon of thoſe great Advantages they get by it.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that the Clergy who live after this manner, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Unbelievers, their Actions being directly contrary to their Diſcourſes. They may long enough ſay the fineſt things in the World, and uſe the moſt ſolid Reaſons; yet the Prejudice which Unbelievers imbibe from their Morals is ſo violent, that it carries it over all that can be ſaid or imagin'd.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:59986:80"/>
               <p>'Tis ſtill much worſe when Clergy-men, whoſe Morals are not better, and who were preferr'd by ill Arts, without being capable of diſcharging their Office, take upon them to cenſure unbelieving Lay-men. All that they can ſay ſerves for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to recal into the Minds of theſe Lay-men their Unworthineſs, or the Artifices they made uſe of to get Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nay, and what they ſay upon ſuch Occaſions does paſs for a Continuation of their unlawful Ways. 'Tis believ'd they perſiſt in acting a part, and all the Marks they give of their Zeal procures them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Reputation of being the beſt Comedians. Mens Eyes are fix'd upon their evil Actions, and their Incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. They think always upon their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations, and the ſhameful Practices they made uſe of to come at the Dignity which they enjoy. 'Tis remember'd that they made aſſiduous Court to ſuch as could ſerve 'em, without being at the leaſt Pains, in the mean while, of acquiring the neceſſary Talents and Knowledg for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging this Employment they ſo much intrigu'd for. The Flatteries they ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally beſtow'd upon the Great, to whom they were ready to ſacrifice all in order to be preferr'd, are not forgotten; and there is reaſon to believe they have not chang'd their Thoughts, when they are ſeen every day as ſervile towards ſuch as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59986:80"/>are above them, as they are haughty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Inferiours.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Damaſus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to convert <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> he had no ſooner begun to ſpeak, but this Pagan Hiſtorian would remember the way how <hi>Damaſus</hi> was elevated to the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Dignity: Damaſus <hi>and</hi> Urſinus, ſays he,<note place="margin">Lib. 27. c. 3</note> 
                  <hi>burning with an exceſſive Deſire of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Epiſcopal See, oppos'd one another with ſo much Violence, that they and their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties came to Blows, and to cut one another's Throats after they had ſent for Arms.</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventius <hi>(Governour of the City) not being able to repreſs nor appeaſe them, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to force his way, retreating into the Suburbs.</hi> Damaſus <hi>had the better, his Party having been very zealous in this Affair. 'Tis certain that in one day there were found in the Palace of</hi> Sicininus, <hi>where there is a Chriſtian Church, an hundred and thirty ſeven dead Bodies; nor was it an eaſy Matter to pacify the People, who for a long time had been as it were in a Fury. For my part, when I conſider the Splendor of the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>I muſt confeſs that ſuch as aim at thoſe things ought to oppoſe one another with all their Might to obtain their Deſires: for after they enjoy it, they live at their Eaſe, they enrich themſelves with the Offerings or Gifts of Women, they ride in their Chariots, they are well clad, and make Banquets ſo ſumptuous that they exceed the Tables of Kings.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59986:81"/>
               <p>This is what <hi>Marcellinus</hi> writes of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſus,</hi> and which, no doubt on't, could not diſpoſe him to hear this Biſhop. The good Order and Policy that at this time is almoſt every where eſtabliſh'd, does hinder indeed the committing of ſuch Irregularities; but the ſecret and publick Brigues, the Solicitations for Men neither of Merit or Capacity, are not leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent now than formerly. We ſee as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons who have nothing to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to Preferment, but their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in making their Court to ſuch as could aſſiſt them; Perſons who have no other Talents for diſcharging the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment they ſeek, but that of living ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and idly, join'd to an extreme Deſire of obtaining it. Therefore we ſhould not wonder if Clergy-men thus preferr'd encreaſe inſtead of diminiſhing the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Incredulous.</p>
               <p>Another thing which contributes much to keep up Infidelity among Chriſtians, is, not only that ſuch as profeſs the ſtudy of Religion, and of teaching it to others, are ſlight Obſervers of it themſelves; but alſo that they have often but a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Idea of it, and even in things of the greateſt Conſequence. I will give an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it, whereby it appears that Churchmen do violate almoſt every where one of the cleareſt Precepts of the Goſpel, as much out of Ignorance, I believe, as Paſſion.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:59986:81"/>
               <p>There is nothing ſo ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in the New Teſtament as the Love of our Neighbour; and this Love conſiſts not only in helping, and being compaſſionate to him, in the things of this Life, but alſo in behaving our ſelves cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably towards him, if he be in any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Opinion as to Religion, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when it has little or no Influence upon his Manners. This charitable Carriage is one of the principal Branches, ſo to ſpeak, of that general Love of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whom the Goſpel commands us to love as our ſelves; and it is by ſo much the more conſiderable as it has been of perpetual Uſe ſince Chriſtianity came into the World; and that it ſhall be perhaps till God thinks fit to call all Mankind to render an Account of their Actions. Chriſtians have been divided almoſt from the very Beginning into divers Opinions; they are ſo ſtill, and ſo they will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, it may be, for ever; ſo that Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty towards ſuch as are in Error, or are look'd upon ſo to be, has been always of great Uſe, and will be ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ought we know, to the end of the World. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it may be ſaid, that no part of Chriſtian Theology has been ſo long neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected as this has been. 'Tis but in the laſt Age, and eſpecially in the preſent, that any Reflection has been made upon it. Nor have there been but a very few
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59986:82"/>Perſons that made it their Buſineſs, and dar'd to affirm that it was one of the principal Points of the Morals of Chriſt, in the ſtate of Ignorance wherein we live here below. Moſt of the Teachers of Religion treat with Vigour and Cruelty thoſe they look upon as erring in their Opinions, let their Morals be never ſo good, tho they commonly pardon in others crying Vices. I will not as much as ſpeak of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> whoſe cruel Maxims are abhorr'd by a conſiderable Part of Chriſtians, but of the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment obſerv'd in many Countries where it is not eſtabliſh'd. Nor will I treat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly here of this Queſtion, which would require a Volume as great, at leaſt, as this; I ſhall only touch as much of it as makes for my Purpoſe, without making any Digreſſions.</p>
               <p>How is a Clergy-man treated in many Places if he forſakes the common Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons never ſo little? If he has a Benefice, he is in great danger of loſing it, or at leaſt expos'd to the cruel Slanders of ſuch as would fain get his Place, and who are always a good Number, altho he punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſcharges all his Duties, and that his Morals be irreproachable. But if he be not yet preferr'd, an Opinion contrary to the receiv'd Doctrines, be it of never ſo little Conſequence, is ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him for ever from all ſorts of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59986:82"/>Preferments. And ſo zealous are ſome about the Conformity of Opinions, that the leaſt Suſpicion is enough to do a vaſt Prejudice to any it falls upon. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs a great Number of Clergy-men are ſo uncharitable as to raiſe many Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions againſt ſuch as they do not love. There's not a Conſequence ſo odious but they boldly draw it from their Sentiments, and accuſe them thereof to thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they depend; and whom they often find ſo credulous about the ill that is ſaid of their Neighbour, or ſo little inclin'd to believe the Good, that thoſe Clergy-men in many Converſations ruin for ever ſome innocent Perſons in the Opinion of ſuch as liſten to their Calumnies.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, if a Clergy-man who is already in poſſeſſion of a Benefice, or that aims at one, be a Blockhead, idle, ſpending his time in eating and drinking, ſmoking, ſlandering, or doing ſome very ſcandalous thing, provided he be Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, as they ſpeak, he quietly enjoys what he has got, or is in a condition of being preferr'd in the Church with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing his Manners. Good Men cenſure in vain his manner of Living, without objecting any thing to him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what is publick; but they are not hearkned to, and towards him alone are practis'd the Duties of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which <hi>thinketh no Evil,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.5, 7.</note> 
                  <hi>beareth all
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59986:83"/>things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Unbelievers who have their Eyes principally fix'd upon the Carriage of the Clergy, conclude from hence two things; the one, that good Morals, that is, the principal Duties of Chriſtianity are the Qualities they have leaſt regard to; and the other, that the Body of Eccleſiaſticks is only a mere Faction, where the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Truth is not intended, but to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port by all ways what can procure or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their temporal Intereſts. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous add further, that the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates or Pretenders to the Benefices look upon them as a Prey whereupon they may ſeize whenever they are vacant; or which they may forcibly ſnatch from ſuch as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs 'em by whatever Means they can. They conclude that the end of all this Zeal affected for the Doctrines is no other thing but a good Income, and that they would not vouchſafe even to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about thoſe Doctrines, if this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come were not ſettled only upon ſuch as ſhould.</p>
               <p>'Tis in vain for the Clergy to ſay the contrary to Unbelievers; the conſtant Practice of ſo many Ages and Nations makes more Impreſſion upon them than all the Diſcourſe that can be made to them. From hence it is that they come to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſtianity it ſelf as they do the falſeſt Religions, and ſo die in an incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59986:83"/>Infidelity; by their own Fault, it's true; but alſo by a ſpecious occaſion of judging wrong, which ſeveral Clergy-men give 'em.</p>
               <p>They are by ſo much the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in their Infidelity, as they ſee the Zeal for Temporals very different from that concerning Spirituals. And this they eaſily diſcover by the Diſtinction that is made of thoſe who defend and are paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for the temporal Intereſts of their Party; and of them, who, defending Chriſtianity by the ſtrongeſt Reaſons ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, and after the beſt Method of clearing Peoples Underſtanding, deny not but that there are ſome Diſorders in the Diſcipline of the Church which need Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Thoſe laſt who ought to be eſteem'd and advanc'd by ſuch whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion obliges to favour them, are put back for ever, and look'd upon as very dangerous Perſons, whilſt the firſt are in favour all the while, and are ſure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what they deſire.</p>
               <p>The Incredulous judg by this Conduct that it is not Chriſtianity in general they mind, whatever they ſay, but the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intereſts of the Party; ſince thoſe who conſecrate themſelves for the Defence and Propagation of the firſt are diſgrac'd, and no Reward is thought too great for others.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:59986:84"/>
               <p>Theſe are the principal Prejudices which Eccleſiaſticks by their Fault occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion Unbelievers to entertain. I could add ſeveral things much more home upon them, if I would ſpeak of all the Abuſes committed in the Places where Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is moſt corrupted; but if what I have mention'd does an extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to Religion, what may we not ſay of the reſt? And beſides, the Anſwer I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to make to theſe Prejudices, may ſolve the Difficulties which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from greater Diſorders than thoſe whereof I have ſpoken.</p>
               <p>To ſhew that the Occaſions of Scandal and Stumbling which are given to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous, and of which we have been now ſpeaking, ought not to injure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in general, and that conſequently they ſhould not hinder any from acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging its Truth; it muſt be conſider'd in it ſelf, and in its firſt Original. If there have been Additions made to it, and if it has been ſince corrupted, that is no Defect in Chriſtianity, but their Fault who made theſe Additions or Alterations.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have read the Goſpel, and the other Writings of the Apoſtles, cannot ſay that the firſt Founders of the Chriſtian Religion have engag'd ſuch as would preach it to diſcharge this Duty from any Conſideration of Intereſt. Jeſus Chriſt promiſes nothing but Perſecutions and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59986:84"/>in this World to the firſt Miniſters of the Goſpel: <hi>I ſend you forth,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Mat. 10.16</note> 
                  <hi>as Sheep among Wolves. They will bring you into their Synagogues, and ſcourge you. You ſhall be brought for my ſake before Governours and Kings. The Brother ſhall deliver the Brother to Death, and the Father the Child; and the Children ſhall riſe up againſt their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and cauſe them to be put to Death; and you ſhall be hated of all Men for my Name's ſake.</hi> He alſo ſays unto one of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, whom he call'd after an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry manner;<note place="margin">Acts 9.16.</note> 
                  <hi>I will ſhew him how great things he muſt ſuffer for my Name's ſake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Event did quickly convince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles that theſe Predictions of Jeſus Chriſt were not vain. The Jews and the Heathens, for the moſt part, gave them a very ill Reception; and many of Chriſt's firſt Diſciples ſuffer'd Death for diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Function wherewith their Maſter honour'd them. It cannot be ſaid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that it was Intereſt which engag'd them in it, or that confirm'd them in their firſt Undertaking. Had Jeſus Chriſt made a conſiderable Proviſion for ſuch as would preach his Goſpel (as he might, and his Doctrine be never the falſer) it muſt be confeſs'd that it would have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what difficult to ſhew Unbelievers that the Apoſtles did not act at all by any Intereſt, and we ſhould want a moſt conſiderable Proof of their Sincerity, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59986:85"/>of the Truth of thoſe Matters of Fact which they preach'd. Herein we have Matter of praiſing Divine Providence that has taken ſuch Care about the firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing of the Goſpel, as to prevent thoſe diſadvantageous Suſpicions which People might nouriſh concerning any Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment like the preſent State of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. If Jeſus Chriſt himſelf had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd all the Conveniences of Life; as if he had been exalted, for example, upon the temporal Throne of the Family of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> from whom he was deſcended; then his Morals, as fine as they are, and even the Sanctity of his Life had never made any Impreſſions upon Mens Minds; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, when any great temporal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is join'd to Vertue, or made the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it, we eaſily ſuſpect then that ſuch as adhere to it are more influenc'd by this Advantage than by Vertue it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Since that time the Chriſtian Religion being well eſtabliſh'd, the Piety of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors has not only provided for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of thoſe who ſucceeded in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Functions; but alſo, conſidering all Places, for their Conveniences, and a conſiderable Expence in which they were engag'd. As ſoon as Perſons of Quality became Chriſtians, and that the Emperors themſelves embrac'd it, it was thought fit that the principal Guides of the Church ſhould live in ſome Splendor, without
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59986:85"/>which they muſt become contemptible, and unable not only to keep up their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect with the People, but likewiſe with Kings, and Men of the firſt Order. To conſider Mankind ſuch as it is now, and ever will be, and not ſuch as it ought to be, it is evident that this Settlement was neceſſary after Chriſtianity became the governing Religion.</p>
               <p>Upon this it happen'd that many of thoſe who aim'd at Eccleſiaſtical Dignities did look upon them as mere temporal Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, whereby they might live great. But the Worldlineſs of thoſe People can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, without Injuſtice, be attributed to the Chriſtian Religion, nor to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of it, as I have ſhewn. Nor can they be blam'd neither, who have augmented the Dignity and Revenues of Church-men, becauſe they did it with a good Deſign, and that it is poſſible enough for ſuch as enjoy thoſe Dignities and Revenues, to make a better Uſe of them than moſt do. If after making as modeſt Expences as can be for the external Part, they ſpend the reſt of their Revenues to ſome good Purpoſes; where is the harm of this? Is there any Law in being that prohibits it? No ſurely; neither is there any thing that hinders them from being obliging, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and moderate, or from remembring their former Condition before they came to theſe Dignities. Who would not heap
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59986:86"/>Commendations upon them, if they did ſo manage themſelves that it might appear as much as poſſible that it was not to ſatisfy their Avarice, or any other Paſſion, they endeavour'd to obtain the Dignities afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid; but to edify the Church more, and to lead the People to Piety and Charity by their Example, which is of much greater Efficacy than their Diſcourſes? Have there not been in divers Places and Times ſome Clergy-men that behav'd themſelves after this manner, and who drew upon themſelves the Reſpect and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the whole World. Such were the Biſhops whereof <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> ſpeaks immediately after giving that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of thoſe Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> which I mention'd before. His Teſtimony is of ſo much greater Weight as he was a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and ſhews every where clear Tokens of his Sincerity. <hi>They might,</hi> ſays he, <hi>be really happy, if deſpiſing the Grandeur of the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>wherein they conceal'd their Vices, they had imitated the way of Living of ſome Prelates in the Provinces whom the Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of their Tables, the Simplicity of their Habit, and their Eyes always fix'd upon the Ground, did render acceptable to God, and to his true Worſhippers, as vertuous and modeſt Perſons.</hi> Therefore it is unjuſtly done of Unbelievers to attribute to the old or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Chriſtianity the Faults of thoſe who abuſe the Eccleſiaſtical Dignities; and to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59986:86"/>conclude from hence the Falſity of the Chriſtian Religion is the worſt Reaſoning that can be.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing may be anſwer'd to the Objections of Unbelievers drawn from the ſcandalous manner after which ſeveral Clergy-men have been preferr'd, and ſpend the Revenues deſtin'd by their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for Men fit to edify the Church. If they make a mere Trade of theſe Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and look upon their Revenues as Penſions granted to their Importunities or Flatteries, is this either the Fault of the Religion it ſelf, or of the Founders of thoſe Benefices? Do we not ſee many vertuous Clergy-men who have been advanc'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their Merit, and that make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Uſe of their Dignities and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues?</p>
               <p>'True it is indeed, that thoſe who abuſe them are not proper Perſons to cure the Incredulous of their Prejudices, and that, far from edifying ſuch as know them, they cannot fail almoſt, conſidering Mens Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, of corrupting or ſcandalizing them. 'Tis the Duty therefore of all good Men to provide a Remedy againſt this Diſgrace of the Chriſtian Religion, and to ſtop the Mouths of Unbelievers.</p>
               <p>If the Author of the Chriſtian Religion, or thoſe who firſt ſpread it throughout all the World, had order'd their Diſciples to ſuffer no Diverſity of Opinions, not
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59986:87"/>even in things that are not eſſential, and to perſecute thoſe who would not in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing follow the Sentiments of the greateſt Number; the Libertines might then queſtionleſs juſtly attribute to them all the ſad Conſequences that proceed from that intolerating Principle whereof ſome Divines make Profeſſion. But 'tis juſt the contrary; the Founders of the Chriſtian Religion recommend nothing ſo much as Moderation and Charity in ſuch Diſſenſions.</p>
               <p>The Jews and the Heathens that were converted to Chriſtianity agreed not well with one another in the Days of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. The Jews, among other things, would have the Gentiles obſerve the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Meats which the Levitical Law introduc'd, and condemn'd all thoſe who refus'd to do it. The Gentiles, who knew that God requir'd this Obſervation only from the Jews, and that too but whilſt they had a ſeparate Government to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, deny'd Submiſſion to this Yoke, and laugh'd at the Superſtition of the Jews. Now what did the Apoſtles in this Affair? What Counſel does St. <hi>Paul</hi> give his Diſciples? Do they ſay that the one muſt follow the Practice and Opinions of the other in all things, under pain of Excommunication? Do they order the Chriſtian Church to perſecute, as ſoon as ſhe could be able, all thoſe whoſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59986:87"/>ſhould in any thing differ from the Majority? Nothing leſs than all this: For the Apoſtles divide the Controverſy, as it were; and will have both the Parties to have a Condeſcenſion for one another. They do not enjoin the Jews to eat without ſcruple the Fleſh of thoſe Creatures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in their Law; nor do they on the other hand ſubject the Gentiles to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the Jews. They only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them,<note place="margin">Acts 15.29.</note> 
                  <hi>to abſtain from Meats offer'd to Idols, and from Blood, and from things ſtrangl'd;</hi> becauſe the Jews were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly offended to ſee thoſe who believ'd in Jeſus Chriſt, and kept Company with the Apoſtles, eat ſuch things, whereof they thought the Uſe forbidden all Mankind. They declare, <hi>that it ſeem'd good to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt and to them, to lay upon them no greater Burden than thoſe neceſſary things.</hi> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> after telling the Corinthians, <hi>that no Man can lay any other Foundation than what is already laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> adds,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>That if any Man builds upon this Foundation Gold, Silver, precious Stones,</hi> (that is, true Doctrines) <hi>Wood, Hay, Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> (that is to ſay falſe Doctrines, tho not deſtroying the Foundation) <hi>the Fire ſhall try every Man's Work; and that if any Man's Work abide, he ſhall receive a Reward; but that if any Man's Work ſhall be burnt, he ſhall indeed ſuffer Loſs, but yet ſhall be ſav'd ſo as by Fire.</hi> In his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:59986:88"/>where he ſpeaks diſtinctly of that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy decided by the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.1, &amp;c.</note> hear what Advice he gives them; <hi>Him that is weak in the Faith receive, but not to doubtful Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: for one believeth that he may eat all things, another who is weak eateth Herbs. Let not him that eateth deſpiſe him that eateth not, for God hath received him. Who art thou that judgeſt another Man's Servant? To his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth; yea he ſhall be holden up; for God is able to make him ſtand;</hi> that is, to keep him from being led by Weakneſs into fundamental Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. St. <hi>Paul</hi> adds ſeveral things upon the ſame Subject, which now I ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; but all that he ſays does clearly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that we muſt bear with one another in ſuch things as deſtroy not the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, which do not hinder us from putting our Truſt in Jeſus Chriſt, or keeping his Commandments.</p>
               <p>Now if after all this, other Maxims are obſerv'd in our time, they cannot be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Apoſtles, nor conſequently be look'd upon as Doctrines of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion. Whatever Imputations they may be liable to who violate this Branch of Charity relating to the Erroneous, (for they give too great Occaſions of Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) yet theſe diſadvantageous Characters cannot ſtain the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>It is no way needful for me to prove, that according to the Notions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59986:88"/>the Care of the ſpiritual Part is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably above that of the temporal. The whole Syſtem of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſpeaks no other Language; and therefore they deſerve much more Eſteem who endeavour to extirpate Infidelity and Vices, than they who defend the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Intereſts of Chriſtianity; for the firſt are infinitely more uſeful to the Church than the latter. Wherefore if ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Intereſt of Religion to that of a Party, they muſt be blam'd, and not the Religion which wholly condemns this Practice.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> That the Diviſions reigning among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould not hinder any from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that the Chriſtian Religion is true.</head>
               <p>WE learn from Eccleſiaſtical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that from the very Deceaſe of the Apoſtles, nay and during their Lives too, the Chriſtians begun to be divided into Parties. But it was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in the ſecond Age that a world of Sects grew up which tore Chriſtianity into pieces after a moſt ſcandalous manner; and ſince that time one Sect has conſtantly ſucceeded another, ſo that it may be ſaid
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59986:89"/>the Chriſtian Church was never without Diviſions. What is yet worſe is, that moſt of thoſe Sects mutually condemn one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Each of them pretends that there is no Salvation for ſuch as embrace not the Doctrines they teach. I need not enter upon Particulars, or bring diſtinct Proofs of theſe Diviſions and Anathemas; for they are Matters of Fact but too well known to all the World.</p>
               <p>From hence Unbelievers take an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſaying that the Chriſtian Religion is like all others, and that if it had come from Heaven, as 'tis ſaid to do, Chriſtians would be better agreed than they are found to be. The ſame God, ſay they, who gave it to Men, would take care to prevent thoſe Diviſions that extremely leſſen the Effects of it. On the contrary, it ſeems to be the Apple of Diſcord, which no ſooner appear'd in the World, but it caus'd numberleſs Diviſions. They add, that this keeps Infidels and ſuch as have been educated in other Religions from embracing it: for not knowing which of thoſe Sects it is that teaches the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and being not in a condition to examine them all, they are at a loſs how to determine the Affair. They ask fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſuch as write for the Truth of Chriſtianity, as I do now, which Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion it is we defend; whether it be that which the Roman Church profeſſes,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59986:89"/>or that of any of the other Sects that make a ſeparate Body? There is not, ſay they, any Chriſtianity in general, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you muſt determine for ſome of the Parties; which is it then you have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to defend?</p>
               <p>There are another ſort of People whoſe Conduct is not more prudent than that of the Incredulous, and who after another manner abuſe the Diviſions which reign among Chriſtians. They ſay, that not being capable to examine all theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Sentiments, they find no Method more ſure than implicitly to embrace the Religion of the Country wherein they live, ſince they muſt needs be of ſome Party. The Incredulous reject all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinions of Chriſtians, as equally ungrounded by reaſon of their Diviſions; and ſuch as ſay that without any Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they believe the Religion of their Country, know not well themſelves what they profeſs to believe, and are expoſed to almoſt as much Danger of miſtaking as the Incredulous: for, in ſhort, to reject all Opinions, and to embrace, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing why, the firſt Opinion that offers it ſelf, is much the ſame thing. At bottom the latter are not a greater Honour to Chriſtianity than the firſt, ſeeing they both of them ſuppoſe it deſtitute of any Marks to diſtinguiſh it from Error or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture; therefore I thought it neceſſary
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59986:90"/>to examine in this Chapter the Conduct of the one and the other.</p>
               <p>To begin with the Incredulous, and to anſwer their Objections in the ſame Order that I alledg'd them, I abſolutely deny that it follows from the Diviſions of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that the Chriſtian Religion is not divinely reveal'd. If the Chriſtians could produce a Promiſe from the Founder of their Religion, aſſuring them that they ſhould never be divided, then the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of the Incredulous might pretend to ſome Force; they could ſay that this Promiſe not being perform'd, it was a ſign it did not proceed from God. But Matters are quite contrary; Jeſus Chriſt and his Diſciples conſidering the Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, and foreſeeing likewiſe fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Events, have clearly propheſy'd of the Diviſions that ſhould ſpring up among Chriſtians. <hi>Suppoſe you,</hi> ſays Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that I am come to give Peace on Earth?</hi>

                  <hi>I tell you, nay; but rather Diviſion: For from henceforth there ſhall be five in one Houſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, three againſt two, and two againſt three,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There muſt be Hereſies among you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.19.</note> ſays St. <hi>Paul, that they which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd may be alſo made manifeſt among you.</hi> Here are expreſs Words ſignifying that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles were not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Diviſions, which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion ill underſtood, or rather the Paſſions of Men would occaſion among Chriſtians.</p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:59986:90"/>
               <p>But ſome may ſay, that it is a thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a Religion reveal'd from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to cauſe ſo many Diviſions, eſpecially having ſuch fatal Effects. I grant this, if it be ſuppoſed that this Religion does of it ſelf inſpire the Spirit of Diviſion and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; but if it be only the innocent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of them, there can be no ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence drawn from hence againſt it. Now it cannot be doubted, but that Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is directly oppoſite to the Diviſions of Chriſtians, ſince Jeſus Chriſt preſſes no Commandment ſo ſtrongly as that of our loving one another,<note place="margin">John 13.33, 34. &amp; 15.12, 17, &amp;c.</note> and conſequently of living peaceably one towards another. Every one knows this. Chriſt however knew ſo perfectly the Heart of Man, that he ſaw very well <hi>the new Command of loving one another,</hi> which he left his Diſciples, ſhould not be well obey'd; and that his Doctrine, as peaceable as it was, would frequently ſerve for a Pretence to the Paſſions of Men in occaſioning infinite Broils; ſo that if his Deſign were to be explain'd by the Event, it might be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſaid he came to bring Diviſions on the Earth. This is the Senſe of thoſe Words I cited a little above.</p>
               <p>But what, ſome will ſay? Does it not ſeem a thing becoming God, for the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Religion and for the Good of Men, to prevent its producing any Diſorders, not even by Accident? No ſurely, God
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59986:91"/>ought not to intervene by the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Effects of his Power to keep the Peace among Chriſtians. The Reaſon of this is, that his Deſign, as it appears both by Revelation and the thing it ſelf, was by no means to bring Men, at leaſt ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, to his Obedience by Miracles of this nature; but only by Laws to which he fix'd Rewards and Puniſhments, as I have already ſaid in<note n="*" place="margin">Part 1. Ch. 3.</note> another Place. This is what St. <hi>Paul</hi> hinted to in one word in that Paſſage I cited before, when he ſays, <hi>That there muſt be Hereſies, that they which are approved may be alſo made manifeſt.</hi> This plainly ſignifies that if God by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means would hinder all Diviſions about his Doctrine among Chriſtians, it ſhould be no longer a Vertue to remain ſtedfaſt on the good ſide, or to quit the bad in order to join it. Thoſe who love the Truth, and keep to it out of Choice and Knowledg, would be confounded with thoſe who ſhould embrace it without knowing why, and who are as ready to embrace an Error, were they taught it. The conſtant Profeſſion of the Truth could not expect any Reward, ſince it would not be in any ones Power to forſake it. In a word, it would be ſuperfluous to propoſe any Laws at all to Men, ſince it could not be in their Power to violate them; for God, according to our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Suppoſition, would prevent this by his Omnipotency.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:59986:91"/>
               <p>But it will be ſaid perhaps that a wiſe Legiſlator who foreſees that his Laws may be ill underſtood, or cauſe Diviſion ſhould he expreſs them obſcurely, would take care to uſe very clear Expreſſions; and that God, who foreſees all things, ought by Conſequence to expreſs his Will in ſo clear a manner as to prevent all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes which we ſee now among Chriſtians. To this I anſwer, that God has expreſs'd himſelf plainly enough in the Writings of the Apoſtles, eſpecially about what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be believ'd, hop'd, and done, to obtain Salvation according to the Laws of the Goſpel; and that there would be no Diſputes about Neceſſaries if Men did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with the Scripture-Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. What made Diviſions ſpring among Chriſtians are the Additions and ill-drawn Conſequences, and not the Text of the New Teſtament. Such as look in it only for the Truth, they eaſily find this, and are never deceiv'd about any thing eſſential; but thoſe who would find therein what vain Subtlety and humane Intereſts or Paſſions have added to it, are apt, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, to be deceived every moment. In a word, to all ſincere Perſons who love the Truth preferably to every other thing, the Goſpel is as clear as the Sun, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not occaſion any conſiderable Diſpute: But to Men govern'd by their Paſſions, and conceited of their Prejudices, the moſt
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59986:92"/>evident things in the World are obſcure. There is no Law ſo clear, but a Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler may raiſe a thouſand Difficulties about it; and if a Legiſlator ſhould not paſs for a wiſe Man, except he expreſly prevented all poſſible Difficulties, and mark'd all the Caſes wherein ill-diſpoſed Perſons would abuſe his Laws, there had never been any Legiſlator to whom any Wiſdom could be attributed. None ever undertook to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch a thing, becauſe then they would be oblig'd to write an infinite Number of Volumes, to which ſomething new muſt be added every Moment, ſince there might happen infinite Caſes every day. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if God had deſign'd to prevent all thoſe Controverſies already mov'd, or that ſhall hereafter ariſe about the Senſe of Revelation, and rejected by Name all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Errors, he muſt have made ſo great a Number of Volumes, that, to uſe St. <hi>John</hi>'s Expreſſion, <hi>the World could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them,</hi> and their Multitude would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>For proof that the cleareſt Laws, and the moſt proper to prevent all ſorts of Diſorders, become obſcure to ſuch as are not diſpos'd to obſerve them; we need only call to mind what is already ſaid of the Charity to be us'd towards thoſe who are in an Error about any Article of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It was not poſſible to ſpeak more clearly or effectually upon this Head than
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59986:92"/>the Apoſtles have done: and nevertheleſs the moſt part of Chriſtians practiſe at this time what they ought to have done if they had ſaid juſt the contrary. Thus they diſpute about the Senſe of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, rather becauſe they are blinded by Prejudices, and willing to diſpute, than becauſe it is in it ſelf obſcure with regard to neceſſary Doctrines; and God was not oblig'd by any means to condemn expreſly all poſſible Errors to prevent Diſputes, as I have now ſhewn.</p>
               <p>The Diviſions that are among Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſhould not hinder the Incredulous or Infidels from giving them the hearing when they exhort them to embrace the Chriſtian Religion. The Reaſon of this is, that all Chriſtians, notwithſtanding their Diviſions, are agreed about certain Articles, by the Examination whereof Unbelievers muſt neceſſarily begin; and not by thoſe particular Controverſies which divide Chriſtians. All Chriſtians are agreed about the Creation of the World, about Revelation in general, the moral Precepts of the Goſpel, with the Rewards and Puniſhments annex'd to them. They agree likewiſe about the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, the Divine Miſſion of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and laſt Judgment. Theſe are the things they undertake to prove firſt, when they deal with Infidels or Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59986:93"/>and this is what with common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent they call the Principles of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which they prove all with like Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>'Tis juſt with Religion as with ſeveral other Sciences in which the Learned are not leſs divided. There are very great Diſputes, for example, among the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, about the Cauſes of Diſeaſes, the Virtues of Remedies, and the way of applying them; but, maugre all their Conteſts, there are certain things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in they all agree. In Anatomy, in the Deſcription of the Symptoms of Diſeaſes, in the Knowledg of Simples, and in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry there are a thouſand things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of no body doubts, and which are the moſt important Parts of Phyſick, with which a Learner of this Science muſt firſt begin. And 'tis ſo, as I have already ſaid, with the different Sects of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. As the Diverſity in the Opinions of Phyſicians keeps none that has a mind to it from examining the Principles of their Art; ſo the Difference of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Religion cannot diſcourage the Lovers of Truth: and indeed, as we have ſhewn in the firſt Part, they are other ſorts of Motives which take off the Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous from examining it.</p>
               <p>What I have call'd <hi>the Principles of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> is the ſame thing with what we may name, <hi>Chriſtianity in general.</hi> Altho
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59986:93"/>there be no Chriſtian Society that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all its Belief within thoſe Ideas only about which all Chriſtians are agreed; yet this hinders not but that thoſe Ideas may include the fundamental Doctrines of Chriſtianity, and that we muſt be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd about theſe before we examine any particular Doctrine of thoſe Societies which profeſs our Religion. This is alſo what I undertake to defend in this Work, and from the Truth or Falſhood whereof depends all the reſt. If it be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, for inſtance, that theſe general Doctrines are true, we muſt then examine in what Society they are moſt purely taught: but were they found to be falſe, then we needed not examine any particular Sect; ſeeing that all defending the ſame ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Principles, if they were not true, then all the Sects would be all equally falſe.</p>
               <p>It is manifeſt then that the Diviſions of Chriſtians ought not to be any Prejudice againſt Chriſtianity in general, nor hinder the Incredulous from examining it. Nor is it leſs certain that they cannot take any Perſon off from this Examen, that has a mind to embrace any one Sect. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions indeed render this Diſquiſition ſomewhat difficult, but by no means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. I ſhall be told, no doubt, that this is true with reſpect to Men of Letters or underſtanding Perſons; but the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, what the ignorant Populace muſt
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59986:94"/>do in theſe Diviſions? As they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly judg'd incapable of this Diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo the ſureſt way for them, ſome think, is to engage with the firſt Party that offers it ſelf.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, firſt, That to paſs for a good Chriſtian one muſt know, at leaſt, thoſe general Principles we ſpoke of. If there be People ſo ſtupid as to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend nothing of 'em, tho otherwiſe Men of good Morals, we leave the Diſpoſal of them to God; but, as I ſaid in another Place, they differ very little from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages of <hi>America</hi> or <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, If ſuch as have Parts enough to comprehend the Principles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and Vertue enough to frame their Morals according to this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, are not able however to take Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of thoſe Differences which divide Chriſtians; it is not very difficult to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what they muſt do both in Equity and Prudence. They ought not to judg of what they do not underſtand. They ought neither to approve or condemn any Party concerning the Doctrines in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. He that requires more of them, makes them paſs the Limits of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and obliges them to form an unjuſt and haſty Judgment. While they find themſelves uncapable to receive true Information of the Reaſons on all ſides, or to diſtinguiſh certainly which is in the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59986:94"/>wrong, they ought to ſuſpend their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about Controverſies. 'Tis a Rule authoriz'd by common Senſe not to judg of what we do not underſtand; nor can we believe, without renouncing common Senſe, that God would have any body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce without good Reaſons for it. St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.23.</note> that <hi>whatever is not of Faith</hi> (or Perſwaſion) <hi>is Sin;</hi> that is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we reſolve to act in point of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for this is what he there treats of) we muſt be perſwaded that we are in the right: but this we cannot be, unleſs we evidently know why.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid perhaps that God may be pleas'd with this Cautiouſneſs and Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but that Men will not bear it, ſince they commonly oblige thoſe that live in the ſame Society with them to declare for all their Doctrines. Notwithſtanding whatever is requir'd of Men, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they keep to this Warineſs whereof I ſpoke; becauſe they are luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kily uncapable of underſtanding ſuch Controverſies as divide Chriſtians; altho they eaſily comprehend the Ground of Chriſtianity, which is ſuted to all ſorts of Capacities that are not quite deſtitute of their reaſoning Faculty about what makes no Impreſſion upon the Senſes. Thoſe People giving little Attention to what they do not underſtand, apply themſelves wholly to what they comprehend. Thus
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59986:95"/>they leave their Controverſies to Divines, whilſt they mind only the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity. Such as are not more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet venture further in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and act accordingly, do judg and act manifeſtly againſt common Prudence and natural Equity. To imagine that God would have any Regard to ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Conduct, is to extinguiſh the moſt certain Light of Reaſon or Religion.</p>
               <p>In the third place, If it be ſuppos'd that ſuch as cannot enter into the Detail of Controverſies have nevertheleſs a little more Knowledg than thoſe I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, then they may eaſily determine themſelves after this manner, without running any risk at all. By reading Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Faith they may learn wherein all Parties in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> agree, and take that for the Foundation and Ground of Religion; becauſe it is not likely that ſo many different Parties who diſpute ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly againſt one another, ſhould agree in acknowledging certain Heads as the true Doctrines of Chriſtianity, if they were not ſuch in effect. By the different Parties of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> I underſtand not all the Sects that ever have been, but ſuch as ſubſiſt at this time. The greateſt Part of the old Sects are unknown to us; and if we may judg of them by what we read in Hiſtory, moſt of them did maintain ſuch extravagant Poſitions, or led ſuch ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:59986:95"/>Lives, that it was no difficult thing to diſcover their Errors. If to this they add the reading of the New Teſtament, they will be entirely confirm'd in this Point. But if after all this any would oblige them to approve or condemn beyond what they underſtand, or what they learnt in the New Teſtament, and from the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Conſent of all Chriſtians, they may deſire to be rightly inform'd concerning thoſe things. And if ſuch Informations be ſo obſcure that they cannot underſtand them, after all poſſible Application on their part; or if they plainly perceive that they are repugnant to that general Idea of Chriſtianity which they found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, then they cannot look upon them but as falſe or ſuſpected, or at leaſt as unneceſſary. But if they be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to judg according to their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, nor to ſearch after Truth, they muſt retire into thoſe Places where they may freely do it, rather than to live againſt the Light of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not enlarge more upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and 'tis an eaſy Task to infer from what I have here ſaid the neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to anſwer all Queſtions that may be made hereupon. It is ſufficient for me rightly to conclude, that the Diviſions of Chriſtians cannot engage a reaſonable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon either implicitely to embrace the firſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59986:96"/>Party that offers it ſelf, or to reject all the Chriſtian Religion.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> That the Incredulous object in vain, that Chriſtianity being ſo little known, and ſo ill obſerv'd, is not ſo uſeful to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as a Religion reveal'd by God in favour of all Men ought to be.</head>
               <p>IT is a Doctrine generally receiv'd among Chriſtians, that the Chriſtian Religion is not reveal'd for any one People, or any peculiar Places, but for all Nations, and the whole Earth. And this is certainly the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Hereupon the Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous make two Objections: The firſt is, that there are a great many Nations to whom the Goſpel has not been yet preach'd, and who live ſtill in a profound Ignorance. The other is, that among Chriſtians themſelves every Party affirms that Chriſtianity is not ſo well known as it ſhould be among the reſt. Thus moſt Men know nothing of it, and great part of ſuch as heard of it underſtand it ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, if you believe the reſt, that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing at all to them. The Incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous are of opinion that Providence ſhould
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59986:96"/>have order'd this Matter better; but we can eaſily anſwer theſe Difficulties.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed taught us that the Chriſtian Religion was not as the Jewiſh, and that it ſhould be preach'd to all Nations; but they ſaid no where that this ſhould happen all of a ſudden, or in a few Ages. They have not excluded any People from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Goſpel, or from the Worſhip which God requires of Men, as the Jewiſh Religion did, which was given only to the Jews, and could not be entirely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd by any that did not live in <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> But they did not ſay, that at a certain time the Goſpel ſhould be ſpread over all the Earth, ſtrictly taken, that is, in both the Hemiſpheres; and that all the People of the World would acknowledg the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of Heaven and Earth for their God, and Jeſus Chriſt alone for their Saviour, their Prieſt, and their King. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore be blam'd if the Goſpel is not yet known to all Men. This Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on does no more concern them, than if they were charg'd with the Ignorance of ſuch as liv'd before the Coming of Chriſt. For as God did not think fit to ſend Jeſus Chriſt ſooner, ſo he was not yet willing, it may be, that all People ſhould know him. However there are no People to whom he has not been gracious enough to expect their thankful Returns, tho he has
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59986:97"/>been more kind to one than to another. There is no Injuſtice in this, provided he requires no more than he has given; I mean if he judges all Nations according to their Portions of Knowledg, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly will do.</p>
               <p>It might be ſaid perhaps, that if the Goſpel be not yet made known to all the World, it is the Fault of Chriſtians. Some of 'em think of quite another thing, beſides imparting their Knowledg to thoſe People who live yet in Ignorance. They are at immenſe Expences to ſatisfy their Deſires, or to make War upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but would not be at a very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate one to declare the Goſpel to ſuch as are ignorant of it. The hope of Gain makes them run to the end of the World, and hazard all in order to be rich; but they will not put themſelves to the leaſt Inconvenience to carry the Goſpel where it is not. Nevertheleſs God's Command of doing it to the Apoſtles extends to all Chriſtians, as I could eaſily prove. Others who ſeem more ſenſible of this Command of Chriſt do ſend indeed a great number of Miſſionaries whitherſoever they can. But without blaming their Intention, which is undoubtedly good conſider'd in general, it may be juſtly ſaid that a great Number of thoſe Miſſionaries are not themſelves Maſters enough of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to convert true Diſciples for Jeſus
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59986:97"/>Chriſt among the Heathens. They fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently carry with them the Spirit of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and never gain thoſe People but by impoſing upon them. Inſtead of the plain Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and the admirable Maxims of its Morals, they teach 'em a thouſand uſeleſs, not to ſay falſe things, and an infinite Number of vain or frivolous Practices which have no relation with Charity at all. We ought not therefore to wonder if the Goſpel has not any great Succeſs, ſeeing thoſe whom God has commanded to ſpread it, either wholly neglect this Precept, or not duly perform it. Men are to be blam'd then, and not God, who has given them excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Laws, but not conſtrain'd them to Obedience.</p>
               <p>But Unbelievers pretend that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould have look'd to this by extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Means, and not vainly expect from Chriſtians the execution of thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which, according to us, were given ſo long a time ſince, tho not hitherto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd as they ought. To this I anſwer, beſides what I have already ſaid of God's Liberty to diſpoſe of his Favours as he pleaſes, that the Conduct of Providence ought not to be judg'd of by what is paſt. The Time may come perhaps when Divine Worſhip ſhall be paid to none, except the Creator of the Univerſe, and no other Doctrine be acknowledg'd but that of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59986:98"/>Chriſt. This time likewiſe may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely longer than what is paſt ſince the Creation, and the Ages of Ignorance not go but for a very few Years in compariſon of the times of Light; ſo that the Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's Beneficence in this regard ſhall be infinitely more conſiderable, than were thoſe Ages wherein he ſeems to ſome to have neglected the greateſt part of Mankind.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Religion does teach us, that one day the preſent State of Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Earth ſhall be entirely chang'd, and that they muſt give an account of their Actions to be rewarded or puniſh'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; but we are not inform'd when this time ſhall be: and ſuch as thought it ſhould happen ſoon after the Coming of Chriſt, from ſome obſcure Expreſſion of him or his Apoſtles, were altogether miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, as we ſee now. He <hi>before whom a thouſand Years are but as one day,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.8. Pſal. 30.5.</note> 
                  <hi>whoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger endureth but for a Moment, but in whoſe Favour is Life,</hi> may have Proſpects infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more extended, and which require a great deal more time. We whoſe Lives are ſhort, and who look upon the future as a thing not relating to us; we, I ſay, grow impatient, and the Ardor of our Deſires makes us think the time yet longer than it is: but God who changes not, and that ſees all Time as preſent, conſiders things after quite another manner than we
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59986:98"/>do, and looks upon all limited Durations as moſt ſhort. We muſt not therefore judg of Providence by that ſmall time which is paſt ſince the Creation, ſeeing in the Eternity that follows it, he may chooſe what Space he pleaſes to beſtow liberal Favours upon all Nations.</p>
               <p>This indeed is but a Conjecture, but it muſt be granted that it contains nothing, except what agrees very well with that great Idea which the Chriſtian Religion as well as our own Reaſon gives us of the Goodneſs of God and his eternal Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Nothing demonſtrative can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd againſt this Notion, and Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cannot ſuppoſe it to be falſe without they prove it ſo.</p>
               <p>What has been ſaid is ſufficient to ſolve their ſecond Objection, grounded upon that little Knowledg of true Chriſtianity wherewith Chriſtians reproach one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 'Tis through the Fault of Men that this happens, and God does not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily oppoſe it otherwiſe than by Laws accompanied with Rewards and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But ſome People there are who believe that God will one day reform Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity after an extraordinary manner. This might well be; but ſuppoſe it ſhould never happen, we muſt remember that there is no Sect of any Conſideration ſo corrupted, but that the Eſſence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is preſerv'd among 'em, altho the
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59986:99"/>Additions made by ſeveral of them ſtrangely disfigure it. Such as keep only to theſe eſſential Points, (which is all that may be eaſily underſtood) and who leave the reſt to the Schools, have a juſt Idea enough of Religion, and cannot be ſaid not to underſtand all that is neceſſary to Salvation. The Reproaches of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſts fall rather upon the Preachers than upon thoſe upright and ſincere Perſons, who take of Religion as much as they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and live conformably to their Notions.</p>
               <p>Unbelievers make another Objection againſt Religion, which at firſt ſight ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears difficult to anſwer; and it is, that the moſt clear and eſſential Precepts of Chriſtianity are very little obſerv'd among Chriſtians: whence the Incredulous infer, that it has not a ſufficient Influence upon Mens Lives for a Religion maintain'd to be reveal'd from God, and that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it is not originally Divine. This Conſequence is very falſe, as I ſhall ſhew: But I think it material, before I do this, to enlarge a little upon the Diſorders of Chriſtianity; becauſe in effect the beſt Anſwer we can make to Unbelievers, and the propereſt to get them over to us, is to acknowledg frankly that we are greatly to blame in not better obſerving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, and to endeavour for the future to reform our Manners.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:59986:99"/>
               <p>Whereas the Chriſtian Religion obliges us to think frequently of God, to wean us from the Vanities of this Life, and to teach us our Duties contain'd in his Laws, that we may obey them, by reaſon of the great Rewards and terrible Puniſhments annex'd to them; the quite contrary is commonly practis'd among Chriſtians. God is rarely thought of, and Chriſtians are almoſt as much blinded and poſſeſs'd with Avarice, Ambition, or the Love of Pleaſure, as thoſe People to whom the Goſpel is unknown, altho there be ſome Difference as to the manner of their giving themſelves up to theſe Paſſions. There is a Diverſity, I grant, in their Cuſtoms; but the three Paſſions I nam'd are the Soul of almoſt all Chriſtians Actions, as well as of thoſe of the Heathens. Men are as much intoxicated among us with the Vanities of this Life, as among them; and the Pride or Inſolence of Riches are not much leſs in <hi>Europe</hi> than in the midſt of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Chriſtians ſtudy the Art of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying their Paſſions, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo wholly to it, as if God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd eternal Happineſs to them for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and threatn'd thoſe with Damnation that would ſpend their time in the ſtudy of his Will, or regulate their Manners according to his Laws.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that they ſpend ſome time at Church, that they ſay ſome Prayers, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59986:100"/>read ſome pious Books; but is this time to be compar'd with that which is ſpent in things they may very well be without? or, not to mention the time, will they ſay that they are more deſirous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in their Duties, and to practiſe them, than to grow rich, or ſatisfy ſome other Paſſion? Do they, for example, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Morals</hi> of Chriſt, as well as the cunning Part of Traffick, and ſpeak of the former with as great a Pleaſure as thoſe who follow Trade ſpeak of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Yet it ſhould be otherwiſe, ſeeing Men ſhall not be ſav'd, becauſe they were induſtrious Merchants, but becauſe they knew and practis'd Chriſtianity well. The ſame may be ſaid of ſome other Profeſſions, wherein Chriſtians ſpend all their Lives. Could many of them ſay ſincerely, that they had rather have their Minds full of Knowledg, and their Hearts inclin'd to obey the Goſpel, and be poor, deſpis'd, hated and miſerable, than to be rich, eſteem'd, and have but a ſmall Knowledg of the Chriſtian Doctrine, and obſerve it as 'tis commonly done?</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this lamentable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, they profeſs to live like honeſt Men, they put on the outſide, and as it were the Garments of Religion; but they unluckily ſtop there, and the Conduct of their Life contradicts, as I have ſhew'd, their Profeſſion. They commonly behave
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59986:100"/>themſelves as if the Chriſtian Religion was wholly ſhut up within the Walls of Churches, and conſiſted only in ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Practices; whereas the Apoſtles teach us, that what Religion, next to the Worſhip of God, requires from us, chiefly conſiſts in our manner of living and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with other Men.</p>
               <p>If we examine ſomewhat carefully the publick Behaviour of moſt Chriſtians, we may take notice that they obſerve no Rule of Juſtice among themſelves, but inaſmuch as it agrees with their private Intereſt. If they are the better for breaking the Rules of Juſtice, that is, if the doing of it will prove advantageous to them, and they neither endanger their Reputation, nor expoſe themſelves to the Severity of the Laws for ſo doing, they never fail to break them. They will be guilty of any Fraud and Cheat, provided they be not ſued for it, and their Reputation be not ſo blemiſh'd as to do them ſome Prejudice in the World. They commonly call <hi>an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man,</hi> a Man who can't be puniſh'd by the Laws, and lives not worſe than others, according to the Cuſtoms of the Place he is in. A <hi>good Man,</hi> according to the Notions of the Vulgar, is a Man who keeps a better Outſide, with reſpect to what we call Piety, that is, with reſpect to publick Exerciſes, the frequenting whereof is a very equivocal Sign of a good
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59986:101"/>inward Diſpoſition. We ſee every minute ſome Men careful of that ſort of Duties, and who ſeem to be pious Men by their Diſcourſes; but nevertheleſs they are as greedy and unjuſt as thoſe who profeſs no Vertue. If we examine throughly thoſe <hi>good</hi> and <hi>honest Men,</hi> we ſhall ſee very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that we are only beholden to the Laws and Cuſtom for their outward and ſeeming Vertue, and not at all to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, which they know but very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, and obſerve but as far as it ſerves their ends.</p>
               <p>If Juſtice is ſo generally violated, what ſhall we ſay of <hi>Charity,</hi> which goes much farther? Do we ſee many People who concern themſelves in the Reputation of their Neighbours, as in their own? Are they ſlow and reſerv'd in judging of them? Do they not preſently paſs an ill Sentence upon them, without minding the wrong it may do them? On the contrary, have they not much ado to have a good Opinion of them? Their Judgment of the Sentiments of thoſe who are not of the ſame Chriſtian Society, is moſt unjuſt. They damn them without any more ado, without having any regard to their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or underſtanding their Opinions: And then they do them all the harm they can in this Life. Nay, ſuch a Conduct, ſo contrary to Charity, is accounted <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Devotion;</hi> and Chriſtians fancy (who
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59986:101"/>would believe it, were it not to be ſeen every day?) that they ſhall inherit Heaven, by cruelly tearing and perſecuting their Neighbours. Meekneſs and Charity, ſo often mention'd in the New Teſtament, are look'd upon by thoſe falſe Zealots as Indifferency to any Religion; and, if they are to be believ'd, Fury and Cruelty are the only Characters of a good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Thoſe who ſhould teach others to be modeſt in their Judgment of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and the Doctrines they underſtand not, (which are Duties Humanity ſhould teach us) ſpend their Life in exaſperating ignorant People, by their publick and private Diſcourſes, againſt other Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and are as good Patterns of judging raſhly, and perſecuting without any Pity, as they are ill Examples of living like Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>As for the other temporal Intereſts of our Neighbours, how few are they, I will not ſay, who look upon them as their own, (as they ſhould, according to the Goſpel) but who endeavour to procure them, as they might without prejudicing themſelves? It ſeems, that provided we live well, and have nothing to fear for our ſelves, 'tis no matter whether others groan, for example, under exceſſive La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to earn what is abſolutely neceſſary to them, and live in the fear of begging by the firſt Misfortune that befals them.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59986:102"/>Others may be without any thing, but we muſt want nothing; there is no Reward too little for them, and no Profit too great for us; 'tis enough if they don't ſtarve; but as for us no Riches can be too vaſt. In many Places a Man is accounted even a <hi>Perſon of exemplary Vertue,</hi> when he endeavours not to hurt his Neighbour, tho he does him no good, being neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs able to help him, without prejudicing himſelf. Charity, among that ſort of Men is, if I may ſay ſo, but a <hi>negative</hi> Vertue, which conſiſts in doing no harm, not in doing good, and eagerly promoting our Neighbours Intereſts, as the Goſpel commands. 'Tis extremely difficult for theſe Men to part with their Indolence in the behalf of thoſe who ſtand in need of them, when 'tis not their Intereſt; but the leaſt thing is ſufficient to engage them to act againſt their Neighbours, or at leaſt to do nothing for them.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the other part of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which concerns the Poor, who want our Alms; how many are they, I will not ſay, who deprive themſelves of what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to them, or give away their <hi>Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus,</hi> but who keep any proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their vain or fooliſh Expences and their Alms.</p>
               <p>If among Chriſtians we look for the Vertues we owe, if I may ſay ſo, to our ſelves, ſuch as Modeſty or Humility, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59986:102"/>from unlawful Pleaſures, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Adverſities; I doubt whether we ſhall find more of them than among ſome of the antient or modern Heathens, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided we be willing to do Juſtice to both; however 'tis certain at leaſt, that they are very ſcarce, eſpecially in an eminent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. Nay, it often falls out, that thoſe who pretend to thoſe Vertues more than others, are mere Hypocrites, as one may eaſily obſerve, if their whole Behaviour be carefully examin'd. Humility or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty hinder them not from hunting after Preferments, which they are not fit for; from making extraordinary Expences, when they have got them; nor from treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men contemptuouſly, whoſe Vertues and Talents ſhine infinitely above theirs. Abſtinence from Pleaſures hinders them not from enjoying at leaſt all the Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and when they can, all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of this Life, whilſt they preach Frugality to others. They will do, or are ready to do any thing, rather than loſe the Favour of thoſe, who gave them, or keep them in the Employments they enjoy. The higheſt degree of their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue conſiſts in doing nothing but what will pleaſe the Multitude; and if they are afraid to be cenſur'd, for having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd one of their Chriſtian Duties, or to draw Hatred on themſelves by practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it, we muſt not expect to ſee them
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59986:103"/>prefer Obedience to God's Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to the Reputation they endeavour to get, or keep among Men. The reſt of Chriſtians do the like, not to make their Rulers aſham'd.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The Unbelievers who compare the Chriſtian Morals with the Manners of the Chriſtians, ſay they can't believe that thoſe Morals are reveal'd by God, ſeeing the Effects of them are ſo inconſiderable. They ſay they can't apprehend that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion reveal'd, as we affirm, for the Good and Happineſs of Mankind, and ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent above all others, made not a greater Alteration in the World in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns good Manners. But if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected enough upon the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion, and the State of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> before it was eſtabliſh'd, they would ſpare that Objection.</p>
               <p>They ſhould remember that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion contains ſome Laws, as I have already ſaid, which tho admirable in themſelves, force no body to obſerve them, that there may be room for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments. So that we muſt not wonder if they are violated, as all others are, eſpecially if it be conſider'd that thoſe Rewards and Puniſhments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern another Life. Men, tho perſwaded of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, look upon them as remote, and are ſo affected with outward Objects, which
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59986:103"/>work upon their Senſes or Imagination, that the preſent Time prevails over the future. Beſides, it ought to be obſerv'd that there are different degrees of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion,</hi> tho Perſwaſion it ſelf be moſt true. No body doubts of ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Facts of antient Hiſtory; for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that <hi>Ceſar</hi> overcame <hi>Pompey;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is ſome Difference between the degree of this Perſwaſion, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of that whereby every body is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of what he ſees. Tho thoſe who have read the Roman Authors that were contemporary, and thoſe who ſpoke of it in the next Century, doubt not at all of <hi>Ceſar</hi>'s Victory; yet it muſt be confeſs'd, that the Perſwaſion ariſing from what we have ſeen, is ſtronger and more lively. The Chriſtians who believe the Divinity of the Laws of the Goſpel, and are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times mov'd with it, are, by the ſame Reaſon I juſt now alledg'd, more mov'd with the preſent Pleaſure of giving up themſelves to ſome Paſſion; and ſo this laſt Motion overcomes the other. Jeſus Chriſt foreſaw that Diſorder, and ſaid that few Men would obſerve his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and many break them,<note n="*" place="margin">Part II. Chap. 2.</note> as I have already obſerv'd elſewhere.</p>
               <p>But it will be ſaid, Why does not God make the Rewards and Puniſhments of the Goſpel as ſenſible to Men as what they ſee? Why do they not ſee, if I may ſay ſo, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59986:104"/>and Hell open'd; good Men in the one, and wicked Men in the other? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that if it were ſo, thoſe who obey God, not only becauſe of the Rewards and Puniſhments, but out of Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and becauſe they are convinc'd that his Laws are juſt and reaſonable, could not be diſtinguiſh'd from thoſe who obey only out of Fear, and wiſh that God had been pleas'd to let them ſatisfy their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For 'tis certain that if Rewards and Puniſhments were made ſenſible, every body would pay to God the ſame outward Obedience.</p>
               <p>Beſides, tho it is moſt certain that the Chriſtian Religion is not obſerv'd as it ſhould be, and that the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Manners of Chriſtians and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens is not ſo great as it ought to be; yet it muſt be confeſs'd that Chriſtianity hath ſeveral great Advantages above Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm. Firſt, there is a great Difference between a Commonwealth that hath good Laws, which teach exactly to diſtinguiſh Good from Evil; and a Commonwealth, the Laws whereof approve or ſuffer ſome Crimes which are very prejudicial to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. In the former, good Laws keep at leaſt part of the Citizens to their Duty, and hinder others from running them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into great Exceſſes; but in the other the Law-giver lets looſe all manner of Vices, and puts no Bounds to them:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59986:104"/>from whence it comes to paſs that an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Number of Men give up themſelves to them. The ſame may be ſaid, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſpects, of Chriſtianity and Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm; but I ſhall only alledg two Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. Indeed the Notions of Juſtice and Charity, which the Goſpel hath brought into the World, have not been ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al as they ſhould have been; but however thoſe Notions are the Reaſon why a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cuſtom practis'd among the Romans hath been condemn'd. They took great Pleaſure in ſeeing Men kill one another, or fight with wild Beaſts. So cruel a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion laſted during many Ages at <hi>Rome;</hi> nor was the Humanity of the Roman Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo much boaſted of by their Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ſo much boaſted of by their Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, offended at it in the leaſt. The ſame People as well as the Grecians were ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly addicted to Fornication and Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that they never imagin'd there was any harm it it, provided it might not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice their temporal Intereſts. Thoſe who will read their comical and ſatyrical Poets, will not only ſee the Matter of Fact, but alſo the ſad Conſequences of thoſe Debaucheries. Among Chriſtians one of them has been always deteſted, and not ſo common; and the other has not been ſo great as amongſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, becauſe they are both condemn'd in the Goſpel. The Heathens gave up themſelves to a thouſand infamous Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59986:105"/>not only without being puniſh'd for it, but alſo without feeling any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſes of Conſcience, becauſe they knew not that they were unlawful. Hence it is that they never gave over their Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but when the Body being worn out, could no longer anſwer the Diſorder of the Mind; and that they never ſhew'd any Sorrow for it, whereby Youth might be deterr'd from it. All that old Men could ſay to young Men was, to enjoy the Pleaſures of the Fleſh only as much as they were conſiſtent with the Welfare of their Families. But under the Goſpel the Knowledg Men have of doing Evil, when they give up themſelves to Lewdneſs, is as it were a Bridle, which ſtops a great many in the midſt of their Pleaſures; and a Leaven which often works Repentance, and excites Men to deter others from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay that Juſtice is much better adminiſtr'd among Chriſtians than elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, but it can't be deny'd that their Civil and Political Laws are better. What may be the Reaſon of it? 'Tis becauſe the Laws of the Goſpel have ſettl'd the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Good and Evil, which were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain among other Nations, or rather have introduc'd them anew: from whence it is that thoſe who do Evil dare not aſſert it; and that many Crimes are not daily committed, which otherwiſe would be
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:59986:105"/>committed openly. To live ſomewhat modeſtly among the Greeks and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, one needed to have been well bred up, or to have learn'd Philoſophy; nor did this hinder them from doing ſeveral unjuſt things, which Exceſs only could make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous. But among Chriſtians Men learn whether they will or not, the Laws that condemn them; and no body will be ſo bold as to ſay, that the leaſt Unjuſtice is allow'd them. Princes abuſe not their Authority, as they did in Paganiſm, for the ſame Reaſon; and Subjects enjoy more quietly and ſafely the Fruits of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, eſpecially in the Places where the Knowledg of the Chriſtian Religion is greater than in others.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers can't conclude that the Chriſtian Religion is falſe, becauſe the Divines, whom they know, anſwer not their Objections well, or maintain ſome falſe Doctrines, as true ones, and as being the Doctrine of Chriſt.</head>
               <p>IF I ſay in general that one of the chief things that lead Men into Incredulity who have Wit and Judgment enough, is the weak Anſwers which are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:59986:106"/>to their Objections, and the abſurd Doctrines which are maintain'd againſt them as true ones: No Chriſtian Society will contradict me, becauſe they accuſe one another of very great Errors. Thus, without naming any in particular, I leave to every one the liberty of making ſuch Applications as he thinks fit.</p>
               <p>Foraſmuch as there are many things difficult to apprehend in Syſtems of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which raiſe great Difficulties in the Minds of thoſe who read, or hear talk of them; 'tis no wonder if Men of Sagacity and Penetration propoſe ſome Doubts to Divines. Nay, according to the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of every Chriſtian Society, <hi>viz.</hi> that all others err in ſomething, it cannot be wondr'd at, if it be ſaid that Unbelievers offer ſome Objections to Divines, which they can't reſolve according to their <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis,</hi> or which they reſolve by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting themſelves. Divines upbraid one another with it. Let us therefore ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that a Man, not altogether ignorant, obſerves in the Society in which he was born, that the manner after which ſome Doctrines of the Chriſtian Religion are explain'd, is ſubject to great Difficulties, or is altogether falſe. Let us ſuppoſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the Divines of his Country are very learn'd Men, and underſtand the Chriſtian Religion better than others; an Opinion common enough, eſpecially among
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59986:106"/>thoſe who never went out of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or never read the Books of other Sects. When they perceive that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines whom they conſult ſatisfy them not, or maintain palpable Falſities, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from thence that the Religion of their Country is not true, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Chriſtian Religion is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther falſe. If it happens that a Man ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch Thoughts, never reads the Works of other Chriſtians, who are free from the Errors he is offended at; the more he lives, the more he confirms himſelf in his Opinion; becauſe as ſoon as an Error hath been found out, the longer it is thought of, the better it is known. When Men know nothing better about the Subject in queſtion, and have not Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Learning enough to find out Truth of themſelves, they can hardly forbear doubting of every thing, becauſe they preſently ſuſpect that the other Parts of Divinity which they have not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, are not better; and obſerve that the ſame Doctrine, whereof they have found out the Falſity, is accounted as eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential as others. But let us ſuppoſe again, that a Man, taken up with other Buſineſs, and who has no time to ſpare for ſuch an Examination, (as there are a great many) comes to read Books of Controverſy writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ingenious Men of both ſides, he will often perceive that both Parties at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:59986:107"/>very well, and defend themſelves ill. That Man will conclude from thence, and often with Reaſon, that both Parties are in the wrong; the more he hears them one after another, the more he'll be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of it, and at laſt he'll believe that there is nothing true, becauſe he hath not Parts enough to diſtinguiſh Truth from Falſhood. If we add that there are ſome other external and internal Motives, which make him incline to Unbelief, as there are but too many, that Man will get into a Scepticiſm almoſt incurable, or into a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Unbelief, out of which he will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be able to extricate himſelf.</p>
               <p>What I have propos'd as Suppoſitions, is really to be found in a great part of <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> and there are a great many People in <hi>Italy, France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> (for I muſt tell it, and I ought not to conceal that I don't follow the particular Opinions which prevail in thoſe Places) there is, I ſay, an infinite Number of Men in the ſame caſe, as I have deſcrib'd. They ſee ſome Opinions manifeſtly falſe, eſtabliſh'd in thoſe vaſt Countries by a publick Authority: if they offer any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, they are pitifully reſolv'd; and then if they dare reply any thing, they are overwhelm'd with Cenſures and Threatnings, not to ſay that they are ſent to the Inquiſition, and burnt if they grow obſtinate. Nevertheleſs Divines maintain
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59986:107"/>thoſe Doctrines, tho evidently falſe, with great Heat; they make uſe of all their Wit and Eloquence to prove them. Many Lay-men who want not Penetration, but know no better, think that indeed this is the Chriſtian Religion; and becauſe they diſtinctly apprehend the Falſity of what is ſaid, they conclude from thence that Religion is not true.</p>
               <p>Others add to their Meditations the reading of ſome controverſial Book of Roman Catholick and Proteſtant Authors; and they ſee that the latter altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Doctrines of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> They rightly conclude from thence, that they are falſe, and the utmoſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of their Teachers can't free them from that Opinion. On the other hand, they often find ſome Books of Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Authors, who attack well enough ſome particular Opinions of certain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants; and thoſe Proteſtants are as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky in defending their own Opinions, as they are ſucceſsful in aſſaulting thoſe of the Roman Catholicks. They alſo think that thoſe Proteſtants are in the wrong, and becauſe their Examination reaches not to all the Sects ſeparated from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they confound them one with another, and condemn them alike; ſo that at laſt they perſwade themſelves that Truth is to be found no where. Beſides other Motives which may confirm them in
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59986:108"/>thoſe Thoughts, and which I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy mention'd; they ſee two things which affect them ſo much, that they retain their Opinions for ever, if no better Books come into their Hands, or if no body frees them from the Doubts they are in.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, that it clearly appears that 'tis the temporal Intereſt of Divines to maintain thoſe Doctrines. Thoſe who aſſert them with Heat, and declame with the greateſt Violence againſt other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Societies, are preferr'd, and get the moſt conſiderable Dignities of the Party they are in. On the contrary, if any one ſeems to be modeſt, and thinks himſelf oblig'd in Conſcience to be moderate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who are call'd <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Heterodox;</hi> he muſt needs be very much favour'd, if he be not excluded for ever from all ſorts of Employment, and ruins not himſelf. In ſome Places that's enough to be altogether undone; and almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where if any intimates that he approves not all the Opinions of the Party he is in, (tho he does it never ſo modeſtly) they ſhew him no Pity, he muſt ſuffer whatever Hatred and Cruelty can do, when they are cloth'd with the Pretence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that confirms Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in their Diſpoſition, is, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines will be Judges and Parties in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Doctrines, againſt the cleareſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59986:108"/>of Equity, tho 'tis moſt evident that 'tis their Intereſt to favour one of the Parties. Tho their Deciſions be never ſo unreaſonable and unſatisfactory, they muſt be ſubmitted to, becauſe they look upon them as good and ſolid. Nay, if they are to be believ'd, the Books of their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ought-not to be read; or thoſe who read them ought to do it with a Deſign of not approving their Arguments, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they muſt undergo the Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Parties.</p>
               <p>Unbelievers, who are convinc'd of the Falſity of ſeveral particular Doctrines, and obſerve that they are maintain'd out of a worldly Intereſt, and by unjuſt and violent Means, conclude that Divines, and conſequently all Chriſtians, are factious People, and Enemies to Truth, as well as thoſe who profeſs the other Religions which are ſeen in the World.</p>
               <p>It can't be doubted but theſe are moſt violent Prejudices againſt ſome Chriſtian Societies; but 'tis an eaſy thing to ſhew, that they ought not to involve all Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in general. Firſt, Unbelievers can't ſuppoſe without Examination, as they do on this occaſion, that the Notion Men have of the Chriſtian Religion in their Country, or that of ſome Divines whom they have read, is really the ſame with that of its Founders. Some Alterations may have by degrees crept into the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59986:109"/>of the Chriſtians whom they know, and ſo it may be very different from that of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. No body can be ſure of the contrary, without going to the Source, to compare it with the Streams which are ſaid to flow from it; that is, without reading the Writings of the Apoſtles, and comparing their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine with that which is now pretended to be the true Doctrine of the Founders of Chriſtianity. This Unbelievers are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily oblig'd to do before they affirm that the Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt is falſe. Elſe they would imitate corrupt Judges, who vouchſafe not to examine the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Suit in Law, but give their Sentence at the firſt Report of it. I am perſwaded that if the Unbelievers of the above-mention'd Places would undertake that Examination, they would preſently ſee that moſt of the Doctrines which they diſlike are not to be found in the Writings of the Apoſtles, and conſequently that whatever Chriſtians think now, ought not to be aſcrib'd to them.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing ought to be obſerv'd every where, and Men ought not to judg of the Goſpel according to the Opinions that are commonly receiv'd where they live; or, which is worſe, to condemn it from hearing a ſilly Preacher, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it quite otherwiſe than it is. Yet there are many People who entertain no
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59986:109"/>favourable Thoughts of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by reaſon of the Explications thereof, which they hear from the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, which are but too often ill provided. A great many things ſpoken there, are ſo far from bearing a ſevere Examination of judicious Men, that they could ſcarce be allow'd in the Converſation of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not altogether deſtitute of common Senſe. That ſort of Diſcourſes can't, without great Injuſtice, be confounded with the <hi>Word of God;</hi> tho there are ſome who affect to give them that Name, as if ſuch Preachers were inſpir'd Apoſtles, and authoriz'd with Miracles. They ſhould have a greater reſpect for the Goſpel than to call ſuch Meditations by the ſame Name with the Diſcourſes of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. I had not made this Remark, were it not that ſuch Expreſſions give occaſion to Unbelievers to deſpiſe Chriſtianity, which deſerves as much to be admir'd by the moſt penetrating and ſolid Wits, as many Sermons deſerve to be deſpis'd by the meaneſt and moſt illiterate Perſons.</p>
               <p>As no body could bear the Injuſtice of that Man, who ſhould judg of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an Author by the Diſcourſes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who perhaps underſtands them not, and whoſe Intereſt it is to explain them otherwiſe, and then pretends he may with Reaſon vent his Explications as infallible: ſo Unbelievers can't aſcribe to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:59986:110"/>the Opinions which they hear preach'd, as Apoſtolical Doctrines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have carefully compar'd them with the Writings of the Apoſtles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are willing to be look'd upon as the moſt unjuſt of Men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Unbelievers are guilty of another Fault, which is not much leſs than the foregoing, when by reaſon of the falſe Doctrines which they have read in the Writings of ſome Divines, or heard them preach, they reject all Chriſtianity. For it muſt be granted, that 'tis not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but many Truths may be mix'd with Lies: and as it can't be ſaid that a Book contains nothing but Truth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome few Truths are to be found in it; ſo it can't be affirm'd that every thing in it is falſe, becauſe ſome Lies have been found in it. Is there, for example, any profane Hiſtory, either antient or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern, without a mixture of Truth and Falſhood? Yet no body ſays that Hiſtory contains nothing that's true and certain. They endeavour only to diſtinguiſh what is true from what is falſe. The like ought to be practis'd with reſpect to the Explications of Chriſtians Doctrines which we read or hear. We ought neither wholly to reject them nor embrace them, becauſe there may be a Mixture of Truth and Falſhood. We ought, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to compare them with the Writings
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:59986:110"/>of the Founders of Chriſtianity, and judg by thoſe Writings of Religion it ſelf, and of what is true in the Opinions of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines; this is, if I may ſay ſo, the Touch-ſtone by which only the true Doctrine of the Apoſtles can be known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Unbelievers undoubtedly know, that a Truth changes not its Nature for being ill defended. We ſee every day very good Cauſes ill pleaded by ſome Lawyers, who underſtand not their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Nay 'tis confeſs'd among all Chriſtians, that there are a great many Books whoſe Authors are really engag'd in the Defence of Truth, but they do it ſo ill, that it would certainly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd if it had no better Support. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny People, for example, who have not ſtudied well the Writings of the Apoſtles, ſay they ſee no Character of Divinity in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and can't convince an Unbeliever of it; but never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they believe it to be Divine with as great a Certainty as if they perceiv'd the <hi>Finger of God</hi> in every part of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are, ſay they, inwardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of it by the Holy Ghoſt, without knowing why. That's the Cant of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Phanatick, who equals, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aware of it, the Goſpel with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran, and all the falſe Religions, the Followers whereof may all ſay, as he does, that they are perſwaded of it by a ſecret
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59986:111"/>and inward Operation of God upon their Hearts. But the Apoſtles never ſaid any ſuch thing; all their Preaching conſiſts in ſome Facts, and in good Reaſonings, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the miraculous Gifts they had; and 'tis by ſuch Means they pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove the Divinity of their Doctrine. So that we ſhould wrong them very much ſhould we believe that they taught their Doctrine could not be embrac'd by the means of Knowledg, but by a mere <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Others, to do the Chriſtian Religion a greater Honour, aſcribe to the Apoſtles an Art which they themſelves ſeriouſly<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.17. &amp; 11.4, 13, &amp;c.</note> ſay they have not. They ſet forth their Stile as an admirable Pattern of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which exceeds that of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Romans. What follows from thence? Unbelievers read the Writings of thoſe Holy Men, to ſeek what they are told is contain'd in them; and becauſe they don't find it, they fancy that thoſe who ſaid ſo, deſign'd to deceive them; and thereupon being exaſperated againſt them who grounded in part the Truth of the Doctrine of the Apoſtles upon their wonderful Stile, they wholly reject it. They could not be blam'd for that, if the Apoſtles themſelves boaſted of their Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; but ſeeing they ſay quite the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, 'tis a great piece of Injuſtice to condemn them as Impoſtors, upon the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59986:111"/>Aſſertion of thoſe who aſcribe to them what they never had, nor pretended to have.</p>
               <p>The true Character of the Apoſtles Stile, to ſay ſo by the by, is this. Firſt, 'tis ſimple and plain, ſuch as is the Stile of thoſe who propoſe ſome things, of which they are fully perſwaded. Secondly, 'tis a Stile without any Ornaments of Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, whether it be with reſpect to the Choice of the Words, or the Diſpoſition. If a thouſand ſublime Strokes are to be found in it, they come from the things they ſay, which are very ſublime, not from the Words or Order. Thirdly, we muſt add to it that Providence undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly watch'd over their manner of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that they ſhould always ſay Truth; and leſt, if they had expreſs'd themſelves ill, they ſhould be miſunderſtood by their Readers. But this is not a fit Place to treat of that Subject. I only made thoſe Remarks to hinder Unbelievers from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Advantage at the ill Rhetorick of ſome Defenders of Chriſtianity, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Apoſtles without being aware of it.</p>
               <p>'Tis manifeſt in general, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of thoſe who defend Truth, ought not to prejudice it; and I declare as to my ſelf, that I don't deſire at all to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd in any thing, but when it has been examin'd and compar'd with the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59986:112"/>of the Apoſtles; or that any of my Thoughts ſhould be aſcrib'd to them, but when they have been found in their Works. If I have been miſtaken in any thing, I deſire thoſe Miſtakes may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd to me, and not at all to the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I vindicate.</p>
               <p>There is no need I ſhould ſay here, that the Apoſtles had no temporal Intereſt to move them to preach ſuch a Doctrine. I have already ſaid ſo elſewhere, and I will prove it more at large in my firſt Letter at the end of this Diſcourſe. I will not repent neither that they pretended not their Doctrine ſhould be receiv'd with any Examination, becauſe I have prov'd it in the firſt Chapter of this ſecond Part. So that if Self-Intereſt and Ambition are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Reaſon why Divines maintain now ſome Opinions, and after a manner unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Chriſtianity; 'tis their Fault, not the Apoſtles, who can be charg'd with no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>After thoſe general Obſervations I muſt ſet down ſome particular Examples of falſe Doctrines, which hinder Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from believing the Goſpel. 'Tis but too true that one might write large Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes about that Matter, but I ſhall be contented to alledg three or four Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Doctrines which offend Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and are contrary to the Doctrine of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:59986:112"/>
               <p>There are ſome People now who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that we ought ſcarce to make uſe of Reaſon in Matters of Religion. They maintain that we ought to believe its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, without knowing why; that when the Queſtion is about the Senſe of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, or the Books which contain it, we ought not to reaſon, neither to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it; and that we ought to believe even the things that are moſt contrary to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, rather than forſake the literal Senſe. They are ſo full of this Thought, <hi>viz.</hi> that Reaſon may overthrow all Divinity, if thoſe who apply themſelves to it are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to make uſe of it; and if they ſee any body who reaſon better than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Divines do, or has any Principles ſomewhat different from theirs, which he has embrac'd by uſing his Reaſon, they ſlander him as a dangerous Man, becauſe he ventures to reaſon about the receiv'd Doctrines. Such a Character is always attended with Hatred, and ſtirs ill-affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſons againſt thoſe who receiv'd it from Heaven; and if it were impoſſible for a Divine to live quietly with a Man who endeavours to reaſon well, and grounds the Chriſtian Religion upon undeniable Principles. Others will have us humbly to ſubmit to the Deciſions of thoſe whoſe Profeſſion it is publickly to explain Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, without miſtruſting them, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning at all, becauſe we ought to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59986:113"/>on them as infallible, tho we have no Proof of it. They think 'tis impoſſible for moſt Chriſtians to examine thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; and their beſt way is, as they ſay, blindly to follow their Guides.</p>
               <p>Such Diſcourſes which are commonly to be heard from the Pulpits, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, have made long ago a great many Unbelievers. For the firſt thing that comes then into ones Mind, is, that thoſe who ſpeak at this rate are not very ſure of what they ſay, and deſign to deceive others, becauſe there is nothing, tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo falſe and abſurd, but what may be maintain'd by the ſame Principle. If we were told the ſame thing in our ordinary Affairs, we would really think that thoſe who ſay ſo deſign to deceive us. If they would ſell ſomething to us, and we were told that we muſt not examine it, we would preſently ſuſpect that they deſign'd to cheat us. In Matters of Religion, as well as in other things, we have no other Guide but Reaſon to diſtinguiſh a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from a true one. Beſides, 'tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the uſe of Reaſon we can find out the Senſe of the Words contain'd in thoſe Books wherein we know the Revelation is. Nevertheleſs thoſe Men would have us to read thoſe Books with an unlimited Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity, and be ready to receive whatever we are told, tho it be never ſo contrary to all our Notions. They are afraid, as
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:59986:113"/>ſoon as they hear of a Man who is only for Reaſon, and whom inſignificant Words and an ill-grounded Authority can't ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy. Unbelievers conclude from thence that there is a Deſign upon them, and that Divines very well perceive that the Doctrines which they would introduce can't be maintain'd, ſeeing they will not allow that they ſhould be examin'd. And becauſe that ſtrange Doctrine is cri'd up as one of the chief Doctrines of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, thoſe who have not carefully read the Writings of the Apoſtles, fancy that they have taught it, and involve them in the ſame Suſpicious with ſome modern Divines.</p>
               <p>When Divines have taught Principles ſo contrary to the Nature of Men, they preach <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> and other ſuch Doctrines to credulous Men, which they inſinuate by virtue of that Maxim of not reaſoning in Matters of Religion. But Unbelievers fail not to perceive the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of thoſe Doctrines, and perſiſt the more in their Thoughts concerning the Falſity of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
               <p>But they ſhould obſerve that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles teach us no where that we ought not to uſe our Reaſon to examine whether Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is true or not, or to know the Senſe of their Words. On the contrary, they ſuppoſe every where that we ought to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what they ſay, and not believe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59986:114"/>we are ſure that they ſay nothing but Truth. They alſo ſuppoſe that we are rational Creatures, and able to put a good Senſe upon their Words, by obſerving all the Rules that are made uſe of to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Language of other Men. They no where ſay that they teach us ſome things that ſeem to be or are contrary to Reaſon, and that we muſt part with our Notions to embrace them. They knew very well that they were to deal with Men who judg of nothing but by acquieſcing in their own Reaſonings.</p>
               <p>'Tis true we comprehend not perfectly all the things mention'd in the Writings of the Apoſtles, ſuch as are, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Divine Properties; but we form at leaſt ſome Notions of them which are not at all contrary to Reaſon; there is no need we ſhould have an exact and adequate Notion of them to be ſav'd. Reaſon alſo teaches us that we can't know exactly this ſort of things, nor many others, and that we muſt not judg of things we underſtand not. 'Tis alſo a critical and grammatical Rule, to decide nothing about an equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or obſcure Expreſſion. So that we ought not to ſacrifice our Reaſon and our grammatical Rules to <hi>Faith,</hi> as if it was contrary to them, in order to believe what the Apoſtles ſay; but we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we have not exact Notions of every thing, and ought to judg only of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59986:114"/>ſuch things as are known to us. We ought not neither to part with the Rules of Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, which are grounded upon good Senſe and the conſtant uſe of Languages, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what the Apoſtles ſay. On the contrary, we ought to make uſe of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Critical Rules in their whole Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; and we ſhall ſee that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles that claſhes in the leaſt with the Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or that cannot be explain'd, as much as 'tis neceſſary, by good Critical Rules.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who reject any of them, do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have introduc'd new Doctrines into the Chriſtian Religion, which they falſly aſcribe to the Apoſtles; and both becauſe ſuch Doctrines can't bear the Teſt of Reaſon, and becauſe they can't reaſon well themſelves, or make a good uſe of Critical Rules: for example, what is call'd the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of the Body of Chriſt in the Euchariſt, or <hi>Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which can't be believ'd without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking Reaſon, nor be found in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apoſtles, by uſing good Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Rules; the real Preſence, I ſay, or <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> are Doctrines which the Apoſtles never thought of. Divines declame againſt Reaſon and Criticks in the behalf of thoſe new Doctrines, not at all in the behalf of the Doctrine of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:59986:115"/>
               <p>For my part, having ſtudi'd thoſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as much as I can, I think I may affirm that no Propoſition can be extracted out of the Goſpels, or any other Writings of the Apoſtles, which being expreſs'd in their Words, is not perfectly agreeable to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, if it be interpreted by the ſame Grammatical Rules, as all other Authors are. Moreover, I affirm that one need ſuppoſe nothing but what is moſt reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to know that the Chriſtian Religion is of Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p>Some Divines who have not ſtudi'd the Holy Scripture well, maintain another thing, which is not leſs proper to hinder Infidels from believing in Jeſus Chriſt, than the Maxims I have confuted. They ſay that many Commands of the Goſpel are Arbitrary Precepts, whereof no other good Reaſon can be given but the mere Will of God; or, that he gave them to Men to humble them. They believe that God would have ſome Myſteries in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch as the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> or <hi>Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation,</hi> to mortify Man's Pride, who underſtands nothing of them. They ſay that to deny ones Paſſions, as the Goſpel commands, is a Commandment grounded upon no other Reaſon but the Will of God.</p>
               <p>It can't be doubted but that when we are ſure a thing is of Divine Revelation, we muſt believe it, or practiſe it, tho we
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59986:115"/>ſhould not apprehend the Reaſons of it; and this many Divines ſay concerning ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ceremonial Precepts of the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Some learned<note n="*" place="margin">Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham, Spencer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Men undertook to ſhew the contrary with reſpect to thoſe Ceremonies, and it may be ſaid in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that they have not been unſucceſsful in it. But as for the Commandments of the Goſpel, one may boldly aſſert that there is none, of which 'tis a hard thing to give a good Reaſon, ſuppoſing humane Nature in the State it is in.</p>
               <p>Nothing can be more falſe and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Nature of the Goſpel than to fancy that God deſign'd in part to ſhew only that he is Maſter, by enjoining ſome Commandments which have no relation with the Good of Mankind. Religion was only reveal'd for us, not for God, who, abſolutely ſpeaking, neither wants what we think of him, nor the Worſhip we pay him. He manifeſted himſelf to us, only to make us happy; and gave us ſome Laws fit to make us enjoy a Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as great as can be here, if all Mankind would obſerve them; and at the ſame time fit to lead to an eternal Felicity thoſe who obey them, notwithſtanding the ill Examples of others.</p>
               <p>For example, the Goſpel commands us to deny our Paſſions, or <hi>our ſelves,</hi> which is the ſame thing; not only to give to God that mark of our Submiſſion to his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59986:116"/>Orders, but for the Good of humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. To <hi>deny ones ſelf,</hi> or ones Paſſions, ſignifies only to prefer the Obſervation of the Commandments of the Goſpel to ones unruly Deſires. Now all thoſe Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments tend to the Good of Men, and there is none but what is of that Nature. Let us ſuppoſe that a Man who has been injur'd by another deſires to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; if he reflects upon what the Goſpel commands him, he will find that 'tis one of thoſe Deſires he ought to deny. The Reaſon of it is, becauſe if he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf, he on whom he ſhould do it would not fail to revenge himſelf too; and ſo there could be no end of it, which would altogether diſturb the Society. Wherefore God who form'd it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects it, forbids Revenge, and declares he will puniſh thoſe that ſhall break that Commandment. Let all other Deſires that are contrary to the Commands of the Goſpel be examin'd, and it will be found that they can't be ſatisfi'd without hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humane Society.</p>
               <p>However it will be ſaid, that when the Goſpel commands us to deny our Deſires rather than break any of its Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or to ſuffer Death for it, if it be neceſſary; it has no regard to the Good of the Society, but the Will of God. But if we carefully conſider it, we ſhall find that Men can ſcarce do any thing more
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59986:116"/>uſeful to Mankind than that. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly uſeful to them to obſerve the Laws of Chriſt, which are ſo advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to them; and there is no Example more effectual to encourage them to that Obſervation than that of thoſe who hand rather die than break any of thoſe Laws. If all Men were ſo diſpos'd, 'tis manifeſt they would contribute as much as they could to one another's Happineſs, and <hi>would love their Neighbours as themſelves;</hi> ſo that thoſe who ſacrifice their Life to bring others to the Obedience of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel by their Example, do a thing very uſeful to the Society. 'Tis therefore falſe that the Laws of the Goſpel are Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Laws, and no Commandments given to Men for their Good.</p>
               <p>'Tis alſo falſe, that God would have Myſteries in Religion altogether incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible, only to humble Man. The Doctrine of the <hi>Real Preſence</hi> of Chriſt's Body in the Euchariſt is no Apoſtolical Doctrine; and the Apoſtles have taught none, of which we can have no Notion, not ſo much as a confus'd one, as it may be ſaid of that. To believe a thing, 'tis not neceſſary to have an exact and diſtinct <hi>Idea</hi> of it, but we muſt have at leaſt a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and confus'd Notion of it. For no body can believe what he underſtands not at all; ſeeing to believe that a Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is true, is to acquieſce in the Relation
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59986:117"/>which is perceiv'd between the Terms it is made of, as Logicians teach, and none can acquieſce in a Relation that is not perceiv'd.</p>
               <p>For example: when I am told, <hi>the Dead ſhall riſe,</hi> I underſtand not only the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe Words, <hi>the Dead,</hi> and <hi>to riſe,</hi> but alſo clearly perceive the Relation which is ſaid to be between thoſe two things, tho I don't know diſtinctly the Manner and Circumſtances of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. But if I was told, <hi>the Dead ſhall riſe and not riſe at the ſame time,</hi> without any Equivocation in the words <hi>dead</hi> and to <hi>riſe,</hi> perceiving no relation between an Affirmation and a Negation, I could not believe it. The ſame may be ſaid of all contradictory Propoſitions, they can't be an Object of Faith, which receives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what it underſtands, at leaſt in ſome meaſure. Such is the Doctrine of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> which contains ſeveral ſuch Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>When the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles are propos'd to Unbelievers, as undeniable Proofs of their Divine Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they fail not to queſtion the Truth of them. The chief Reaſon they alledg to make that Hiſtory ſuſpected, is the falſe Miracles which are now given out as true ones, to keep People in their Duty by this pious Fraud. Thoſe who make uſe of that Art, or endeavour to vindicate thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59986:117"/>Miracles, can reply nothing to Unbelievers, without condemning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or betraying the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They are far from confeſſing that they are in the wrong, they boldly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that there is no more reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, than to acknowledg the Truth of their modern Miracles. In the mean time the Unbelievers, who ſee that the latter are mere Impoſtures, fancy the former were ſo too. Thoſe who caſt in their way that Stumbling-block, are bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it, and acknowledg the Truth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they will be look'd upon as Men of no Judgment, or leſs Conſcience.</p>
               <p>But tho Unbelievers may triumph over that ſort of Men, who undertake to aſſert ſome Facts which cannot be maintain'd, they can't ſay againſt Chriſtians in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that the Miracles on which their Faith is grounded, are like thoſe which are ſaid to be wrought every Day. Firſt, Chriſt and his Apoſtles affected not to work Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles every minute, and out of Oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſuch as are thoſe that are now talk'd of. Secondly, Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and thoſe in whoſe behalf thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were wrought, got no Money by publiſhing them abroad, as 'tis now pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd by thoſe to whom thoſe Churches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, wherein they are ſaid to be wrought. That very thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Opinion
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59986:118"/>of Miracles being wrought in a certain Place, brings Wealth to the Maſter of it, is enough to make one rightly ſuſpect whatever is ſaid about it. Thirdly, The Miracles on which the Goſpel is grounded, were done in the midſt of the Enemies of the Chriſtian Religion, among whom it was not ſafe to bear witneſs to thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; and on the contrary, thoſe who having examin'd them, ſhould have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd the Falſity of them, had nothing to fear. Such a Diſcovery had been very acceptable to the Jews and Heathens. But now Miracles are wrought among Men ready to believe any thing, or at leaſt to ſay they believe it, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliver'd to the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> where it is ſet up, or of drawing on themſelves the Hatred of the <hi>Mob,</hi> which ſometimes is not leſs to be fead'd than that dreadful Tribunal. To be ſure that the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of another is well-grounded, he ought to have the liberty to ſay the contrary: But when he expoſes himſelf to Danger, if he ſays the contrary, his Teſtimony is of no weight. Beſides, to be ſure of the Truth of a Fact, one ought to have the liberty of examining it, but no body dares do that now, with reſpect to modern Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, in the Places wherein they are look'd upon as true. Thus there is a vaſt Difference between the Certainty of the Miracles wrought in the beginning of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:59986:118"/>Chriſtianity, and what is ſaid for thoſe of our time. None but thoſe who want ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judgment or Sincerity, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the one with the other.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not forget here, that Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers pretend to take advantage of what I have ſuppos'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that there are no Miracles now. They ſay, that if there is no Reaſon to make us believe that they are neceſſary now; there is none neither that can perſwade us that there was any formerly, becauſe the only Reaſon that could oblige God to work Miracles, many Centuries ago, was the Incredulity of Men which could not be cur'd and other way, and that the ſame Reaſon ſubſiſts ſtill. So that if they are to be believ'd, God is not leſs oblig'd to work Miracles out of his Goodneſs, in the behalf of thoſe who doubt now of the Truth of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, than he was in the time of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to it I ſay, Firſt, that the Proofs we have of the Truth of antient Miracles make them as it were ſenſible, if we reflect upon it; ſo that they may alſo be of uſe to cure our Doubts. It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that God ſhould work Miracles to eſtabliſh the Chriſtian Religion; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſh'd, they are no longer neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe the Hiſtory of Religion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the Proofs of thoſe that were done, at its firſt Eſtabliſhment. But it will be
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59986:119"/>ſaid, that the Truth of that Hiſtory is doubted of, and that therefore new Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are now requir'd.</p>
               <p>I anſwer in the ſecond Place, That if the Proofs of the Truth of that Doctrine are good, as we affirm, and if they are doubted of only out of an ill Principle, they have no reaſon to complain of God's Goodneſs. If there remain'd no Proof of the Truth of the Hiſtory of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, it might be ſaid that God has forſaken us, and deals with us much worſe than with thoſe in whoſe behalf he wrought Miracles formerly. But having very good Reaſons to believe that Hiſtory to be true, they ought to be to us inſtead of Miracles. This being ſo, 'tis manifeſt that Men have not now the ſame Reaſon to wiſh for Miracles, as when the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion was not yet eſtabliſh'd.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it ought to be obſerv'd, that to require new Miracles from God, with and ſhew of Reaſon, Men ſhould have made a right uſe of the Means they have to know the Truth, ſo that after a careful and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Examination they could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd about the thing they inquir'd after, but muſt doubt ſtill of it whether they would or not. Upon this Suppoſition it might be ſaid, that God would be in a manner oblig'd, by reaſon of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to help Mens Incredulity. Hence it is that thoſe who made a good uſe of the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59986:119"/>Revelation of the Old Teſtament, and might be apt to doubt of the Miſſion of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, not out of Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, but becauſe the Proofs thereof were unknown to them, had the Advantage of ſeeing many Miracles in our Saviour's time. But let us ſuppoſe ſome Men of a quite contrary Diſpoſition, who perform not the Duties which the Light of Reaſon teaches us, who have no Love for the Truth, who are full of a thouſand ill-grounded Prejudices, and blinded with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Paſſions, who have examin'd nothing, but doubt of every thing out of a volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perverſeneſs of their Mind and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Can ſuch Men complain becauſe God works no Miracles in their behalf? Will they be ſo bold as to ſay that they are worthy of new Favours, for having deſpis'd thoſe which they had already receiv'd from him? If the Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of our time would but examine themſelves by this Picture, they might eaſily find out the Anſwer we can return to them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, I affirm that Miracles would be of no uſe to ſuch Men. The unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jews, in our Saviour's time, are a manifeſt Argument of what I ſay, ſeeing that being not able to deny his miraculous Works, they aſcrib'd them to the Devils. The Unbelievers of our time would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want ſhifts to bring into queſtion Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59986:120"/>wrought in their Preſence, ſeeing they have found out ſeveral to hinder us from drawing any Conſequence from thoſe of Chriſt, ſuppoſing they are true. But of this I ſhall ſpeak in my ſecond Leter at the end of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore it may be ſaid, that God has more reaſon to work no Miracles in the behalf of the Unbelievers of our time, than to work any. And ſuch was the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Chriſt. When he ſaw ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Men, who requir'd from him ſome Miracles, he wrought none, becauſe he ſaw they would not make a better uſe of them than of other Divine Graces, and would but thereby increaſe their Guilt. The Evangeliſts obſerve<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 13.58. Mark 6.5.</note>, that being come to <hi>Nazareth, he did not many mighty Works there, becauſe of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief</hi> of the Inhabitants of that Town. Some unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Teachers having requir'd of him a Miracle more than once,<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 12.38. &amp; 16.1.</note> he deni'd them, and referr'd them to that of his Reſurrection, whereof notwithſtanding they never had the Honour to be Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Wherefore he ſometimes ask'd thoſe who deſir'd that he would cure their Diſeaſes, whether they believ'd<note n="‖" place="margin">Mat. 9.29, &amp;c.</note> he could do it, to teach them that none deſerves a new Grace but he that made a good uſe of others. It would have been an abſurd thing to expect or demand a Cure from him, had they not certainly known, by
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59986:120"/>other Examples, or ſome good Reaſons, that he was able to do it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who ſuppoſe that the Goodneſs of God ſhould incline him to deal other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with Unbelievers, ſuppoſe at once two things moſt abſurd and altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of Men who pretend to Reaſon. The firſt is, that God ought to have no reſpect to the Uſe Men have made of his Favours, but that the more they encreaſe their Unbelief, whatever the Reaſon of it may be, the more he is oblig'd to grant 'em new Graces; ſo changing the Courſe of Nature, as ſoon as they are pleas'd, doubt of Revelation; whereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of God will depend upon the Will and Humour of Men. The ſecond Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that follows from thence is, that God would be oblig'd out of his Goodneſs to ſatisfy as many Parties as there are Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the World, and every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Humour and Method. For every one of them would ſee ſome Miracles, and as it were put the Divine Providence to a Trial, without minding what it might have done at other times, or in other places. If any can brook thoſe Conſequences which neceſſarily follow from the Unbeliever's Objection; there is no need we ſhould longer diſpute with him. From what hath been ſaid it appears that God is not oblig'd to work Miracles now, becauſe he wrought ſome formerly.</p>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:59986:121"/>
               <p>In thoſe Places where the modern Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are not believ'd, there is an ill Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, as well as in thoſe where they are believ'd, which is very prejudicial to the Chriſtian Religion, with regard to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous; and it is this: Several People who maintain ſome Doctrines of no great Moment and Certainty, with too great a Heat, are wont to ſay, to magnify their Zeal, that if the Opinion of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries was true, the Chriſtian Religion would be loſt, that one could be ſure of nothing, and ſuch other things. In the mean time their Adverſaries endeavour to prove the Truth of their Opinions, and ſometimes prove it ſo clearly, that the contrary Opinion cannot be maintain'd without Obſtinacy. The Unbelievers who are as it were a third Party, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form only the part of Spectators of thoſe Quarrels, conclude from thence that the Chriſtian Religion is not truer than the Doctrines which they ſee ſo well confuted; and thoſe who have exaggerated too much the Importance of their Opinions, can't hinder the Unbelievers from drawing ſuch a Conſequence againſt them.</p>
               <p>There are but too many Examples of that ill manner of diſputing; but I ſhall alledg only one, which will be ſufficient to make Men ſenſible of what I ſay. There have been many Diſputes in this Age about the Antiquity of the Jewiſh <hi>Vowels.</hi> Some
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59986:121"/>have maintain'd that they were invented by the <hi>Maſorethes</hi> ſome Centuries after Chriſt. Others have pretended on the contrary, that they were at leaſt as antient as <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras,</hi> and conſequently grounded upon the Authority of the Prophets. The latter, to ſtir, if it were poſſible, all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> againſt their Adverſaries, exclaim'd after a tragical manner, that this Diſpute was about no leſs a thing than the Authority of the Old Teſtament, and of the whole Bible, which was deſtroy'd by thoſe who aſſerted the Novelty of the Vowels. But <hi>Ludovicus Cappellus</hi> has ſhew'd in his <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Punctationis,</hi> and its <hi>Defence,</hi> with as much Evidence as can be deſir'd in a thing of that nature, that the <hi>Maſorethes</hi> were the Authors of thoſe Vowels. The moſt learned Criticks have imbrac'd his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and look'd upon thoſe who maintain'd the contrary as obſtinate Perſons. The ſame happen'd with reſpect to another Diſpute which that learned Man had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>various Readings</hi> of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>He prov'd that there are many Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which may be preferr'd before thoſe of our modern Copies. Did it follow from thence, as his Adverſaries would have it, that the Authority of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be deſtroy'd, Unbelievers would undoubtedly have reaſon to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and it would be impoſſible to make
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59986:122"/>any tolerable Reply to them. But <hi>Cappellus</hi> ſhew'd very clearly that nothing can be more falſe than this Conſequence, as well as that which is drawn from the Novelty of the Vowels; and ſo he freed the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Scripture from thoſe Inſults of Unbelievers, to which his Adverſaries had expos'd it.</p>
               <p>'Tis manifeſt that there are ſcarce any more effectual means to confirm Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in their Obſtinacy, than the drawing of ſuch Conſequences. For they hear on the one ſide ſome grave and much eſteem'd Teachers ſay after a doleful manner, that if certain Opinions are not true, then Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is loſt; and on the other hand, they ſee Men of great Learning not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg thoſe Opinions, but alſo main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them with very good Reaſons. They conclude from thence that nothing can be leſs certain than Religion, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion even of a Part of thoſe that profeſs it. 'Tis to no purpoſe to undertake to prove the contrary to them, by rejecting ſome Opinions grounded upon very ſolid Arguments; whatever the Defenders of the oppoſite Opinion can tell them, will only ſerve to make them paſs for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Men, and of no great Sincerity.</p>
               <p>This helps them alſo to perceive in many Divines a ſtrange Diſpoſition, which would diſhonour the Chriſtian Religion, if it had any hand in it, <hi>viz.</hi> it does plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59986:122"/>appear, that they ſeek not what's true, but what they think proper to maintain the Doctrines they have embrac'd. When they fancy that if a certain thing was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, ſome of their Doctrines might be doubted of; they don't trouble themſelves with inquiring whether their Fancy be ill grounded, or whether that thing can be prov'd on not, as they ſhould do; but they cry out in a woful manner, <hi>That ſuch an Opinion is dangerous;</hi> that is to ſay, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be eaſily reconcil'd with Religion, as they fancy. This is the true Character of a Pleader, who is not very ſure of being in the right; he ſuppreſſes whatever ſeems to him any way contrary to what he defends, whether it be true or falſe, if he is afraid it might appear from thence that he is in the wrong. Such is the Conduct of the Governour of a Place, who wanting Skill or Courage ſhould ſay, that if ſome ill-fortifi'd and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Out-work were taken by the Enemies, he muſt unavoidably ſurrender the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. Thoſe who obſerv'd the Conduct of both, would preſently ſuſpect the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be in the wrong, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be ſenſible of the weakneſs of the Place, and that neither of them hopes to make a good Reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Unbelievers have the ſame Thoughts concerning Divines, when they obſerve that they greedily collect and catch at
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59986:123"/>whatever can in any manner make their Cauſe better, or at leaſt make it appear ſo. But what ought to be ſaid, is, that thoſe Divines don't know very well the Truth of Religion, and ſtick to it only by a Spirit of Faction or Intereſt. The Chriſtian Religion is grounded upon clear and undeniable Arguments; it ſtands in need of no weak Reaſons to ſupport it; it needs but appear naked, and ſuch as it came from Heaven, to put an end to all ſorts of Difficulties. If any one who do's not underſtand it, and loves not Truth, but only the worldly Advantages that attend it, ſeem to be afraid for Religion; it will never want more able Defenders, who will be devoted to it out of a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple worthy of ſo holy a Doctrine. They will never be afraid as long as Religion is only aſſaulted with Reaſons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That the Difficulties which may occur in the Chriſtian Religion, ought not to make any doubt of the Truth thereof.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE abovemention'd Difficulties ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concern ſome Modern Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines than the Chriſtian Religion, which
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59986:123"/>they explain or defend not ſo well as they ſhould. But becauſe there is no Science without ſome Difficulties, however it be underſtood; it muſt be confeſt that there are ſome in the Chriſtian Religion: of which I ſpeak in this Chapter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I ſhall conclude this Work. Firſt I'll make ſome general Reflections upon the Difficulties which may occur in the Chriſtian Theology; and then I'll alledg ſome particular Examples thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I'll ſhew, that they ought not to make any Body doubt of its Truth.</p>
               <p>There may be two ſorts of Difficulties in a Science; ſome of which don't ſhake its Principles; but others ſhew it is no Science at all, tho ſo call'd, but a Collection and a heap of ill-grounded Opinions and Conjectures. For Example; There are indeed ſome Difficulties in <hi>Geometry,</hi> but no Body doubts of the truth of its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: The Reaſon of which is, becauſe they are all grounded upon clear Proofs, and which can neither become obſcure, nor doubtful. Whatever difficulty there may be, with reſpect to a Propoſition fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing from thoſe Principles, they don't change their Nature; and a Man is more apt to accuſe himſelf of not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Geometry</hi> well, than to doubt of it, becauſe he can't reſolve a Difficulty: or elſe they ſhew that the Propoſition in queſtion is of ſuch a nature as not to be
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59986:124"/>fully reſolv'd. On the contrary, there are ſome Difficulties rais'd againſt <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary Aſtrology,</hi> which not only perplex thoſe who are fond of it, but alſo are the Cauſe why all its Principles are look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as falſe, and all that pretended Science as a heap of Chimerical Thoughts. The reaſon of that Difference is, becauſe the Principles of <hi>Geometry</hi> are either meer <hi>Definitions,</hi> or <hi>Maxims</hi> clear of themſelves, or demonſtrated <hi>Propoſitions:</hi> whereas <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary Aſtrology</hi> is only grounded upon falſe Suppoſitions. So that aſſoon as the Truths on which a Science is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, have been demonſtrated, and there is no fault in thoſe Demonſtrations; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Difficulty there may be in any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition drawn from them, we don't look upon that Science to be leſs certain.</p>
               <p>Now to apply that Obſervation to the Chriſtian Religion, and to the Difficulties which Unbelievers find in it; The firſt thing to be done, when any Objection is rais'd againſt Chriſtianity, is to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Objection directly ſhews that the Proofs thereof are falſe. Tho nothing could be anſwer'd to that Difficulty, if thoſe that raiſe it can't reply to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Proofs of Chriſtianity, that Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty does not weaken the ſtrength of the Proofs; and all that can be ſaid is, that the Objection is about a Thing which we do not well underſtand, or that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59986:124"/>Theology is not perfectly known to us. Wherefore the Incredulous act not wiſely, when they reject the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, becauſe of ſome Difficulties, tho they are not able to confute the Proofs on which it is eſtabliſh'd. Now I maintain that there is no Difficulty can deſtroy thoſe Proofs; and if Unbelievers will mind it, they may obſerve that moſt of their Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections have no relation to them.</p>
               <p>That Obſervation is of very great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Queſtion is about ſome Facts, which happen'd many Centuries ago, and are atteſted by ſome Hiſtorians, whoſe Knowledg and Sincerity have been well prov'd. Altho one may raiſe ſome Difficulties, with reſpect to ſome Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which can't be now eaſily reſolv'd; yet if thoſe Difficulties deſtroy not the direct Proofs we have of the ſincerity of the Hiſtorians, and the exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg they had of what they related, they ought not to make us doubt of the Truth of the Hiſtory. To be able to anſwer all the Queries which may be made about a Relation, one ſhould have been an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of whatever it contains: and a Hiſtory can't be look'd upon as fabulous, becauſe no Body can ſatisfy us now about it, if we have no reaſon to ſuſpect the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians from whom we have it, of want of Honeſty or Knowledg. I could eaſily clear this Matter with ſome Inſtances;
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59986:125"/>but it would carry me too far.</p>
               <p>To go on with the Compariſon I us'd, two ſorts of Objections may be rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch a Science as Geometry, and the Chriſtian Theology. Some do only require the exact knowledg of two or three Propoſitions, to be fully reſolv'd; and ſo they may be anſwer'd in few words. But others require a long Concatenation of many Propoſitions, depending one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another; ſo that one can't be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the laſt, before he is ſure of the Truth and Connexion of many others. In ſuch a Caſe 'tis impoſſible to ſatisfy in few words, thoſe to whom all thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, or the greateſt part of them, are unknown; becauſe they ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them one after another.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, it has been obſerv'd ſeveral times, that ſome Men who have ſome Difficulties about Religion, would have their Objections preſently reſolv'd, without having any regard to what I ſaid; tho that Reſolution neceſſarily ſuppoſes the knowledg of ſeveral other things, which they are ignorant of. Becauſe 'tis impoſſible to ſatisfy them without inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in thoſe things; and becauſe they grow preſently weary with a long Diſcourſe, 'tis a difficult matter to make them ſenſible of their Miſtake. Tho it be their Fault, if they retire without being well pleas'd with thoſe to whom
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59986:125"/>they propos'd their Objections, ſeeing they would not hear them; they fancy they have forc'd them to be ſilent, or to ſpeak of ſomething elſe. 'Tis juſt as if a Man, altogether ignorant of <hi>Geometry,</hi> ſhould hear another ſpeak of <hi>Aſymptot Lines,</hi> or that approach nearer and nearer <hi>in infinitum,</hi> without ever touching one another, and would know, in two or three words, how that can be. No Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician could make him underſtand it in ſo ſhort a time. If hereupon that Man ſhould ſay, that there are very great Falſities in <hi>Geometry,</hi> and that that Science is not more certain than ſeveral others; what other Judgment could be made of him, but that he is the moſt unreaſonable of all Men, ſeeing he would judg of a Thing, the Knowledg of which depends upon many more, without knowing them? The ſame may be ſaid of thoſe, who propoſe any difficulty about an Article of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which can't be underſtood without the help of ſome others, and are angry becauſe they are not anſwer'd in a word.</p>
               <p>Some who want not Wit, and doubt of the Chriſtian Religion, or reject it becauſe they find ſome Difficulties in it, do moſt times make a moſt unreaſonable ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without being ſenſible of it, <hi>viz.</hi> That whatever they do not diſtinctly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, is not true; as if Human Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg ought neceſſarily to comprehend
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59986:126"/>whatever exiſts, or is done in Nature. I could eaſily ſhew that there is an infinite number of things which our Knowledg can't attain to; but it will ſuffice to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve here, that the Principle of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, which I mention'd juſt now, is a meer Suppoſition they are pleas'd to make, becauſe they imagine it raiſes them above what they are. I maintain that this Propoſition can't be denied, <hi>viz. That there may really be ſome things, the</hi> Modus <hi>or Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of which Humane Nature can't know at preſent, tho it ſtudies for it never ſo much.</hi> It ought to be obſerv'd that I do not ſay, there may be ſome things contrary to our diſtinct Notions, which is impoſſible; but only that it may be, we have not the Knowledg that is requir'd, or the Means of acquiring it, to know ſome things; which notwithſtanding are not contrary to what we certainly know. 'Tis neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to make that diſtinction, becauſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral People, who are not aware of it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found things that are extreamly different. We cannot believe what is really contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our clear Notions; but we believe an infinite number of things, tho we know not how they come to paſs.</p>
               <p>Moſt Unbelievers are commonly guilty of another Fault, which is leſs excuſable than the former. Inſtead of being in ſuch a Diſpoſition as is neceſſary for ſuch as ſeek after Truth, they act like Men who only
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59986:126"/>ſtrive to get the better, without inquiring who is in the Right or in the Wrong. They wrangle as much as they can, and if thoſe with whom they diſpute, do it unſucceſsfully, they'll be ſure to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, as if the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion depended upon that. They will not ſhew thoſe, who do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend Religion well, what Miſtakes they are guilty of, but only labour to make advantage of it, that they may the more eaſily triumph over them.</p>
               <p>But when the Queſtion is concerning a thing of that nature, about which no Man can deceive others, without doing himſelf a greater prejudice: and when Truth is equally advantageous to every Body, Men ſhould only labour to find it out, and inſtead of inſulting thoſe who can't ſhew the way to it, they ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put them in the right way. The Spirit of Diſpute is altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſearch of Truth; and a Heathen Philoſopher ſaid well,<note n="†" place="margin">Ariſt. lib. 1. de Coelo, c. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>That thoſe who will rightly judg of Truth, ought to be Arbitrators, not Parties.</hi> Aſſoon as one has put on the Character of an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, he thinks no more of Truth, but of the Glory which may be gotten by tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing over him whom he has aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He is only intent upon his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's way of reaſoning, to take him up up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Occaſions, but not to endeavour to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59986:127"/>find out a better: He conſiders no longer the thing in queſtion, as the ſubject of his Enquiry, but of his Cenſure: He views it on every ſide, to find fault with it, not to know what it is grounded upon. 'Tis certain that this is an ill diſpoſition of Mind, and Unbelievers themſelves cannot deny it.</p>
               <p>After what has been ſaid, 'tis no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if Men, who ſhut their Eyes againſt the clear and beautiful part of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, and only open them to ſee what's obſcure and difficult in it, that they may find fault with ſomething or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould at laſt grow ſo conceited of their pretended Sagacity, as to be almoſt incurable. Such a Diſpoſition is not at all agreeable to the love of Truth, which they profeſs, and can only ſerve to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe one's Errors. And indeed what Truth can he find out, who only ſeeks an Occaſion of diſputing and overcoming? Truth, which often flies from thoſe that ſeek it with Application, offers not it ſelf to the ſight of thoſe that fly from it.</p>
               <p>After thoſe general Obſervations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Difficulties that are offer'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Religion, I muſt alledg ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Examples of the chief Doctrines which Unbelievers are wont to aſſault. There is none they more frequently ſpeak againſt, than what Chriſtians believe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Creation of the World; and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59986:127"/>it is of ſo great Moment, that it may be ſaid this Doctrine being once well prov'd, 'tis no hard matter to get the reſt admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; whereas if it remains doubtful, the other Doctrines of Religion will neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be uncertain. All Revelation depends upon this, viz. <hi>That there is a God, who created Heaven and Earth:</hi> And he that begins not with that, can make no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in the Knowledg of Religion. So that it will be neceſſary to prove it in few words.</p>
               <p>There are two ſorts of Beings; ſome, call'd <hi>Spirits,</hi> Perceive, Will, Feel, and Reaſon; the other, who have no Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, are Extended, Diviſible, and Solid, and are call'd <hi>Bodies.</hi> Thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Bodies are variouſly modifi'd, as we ſee or know by Experience. This is all that we know in the World, beſides God. The Chriſtian Religion teaches us that thoſe Spirits and Bodies, with all their Properties, had a Beginning, and that they were created by a Being, who has no Beginning. This is what Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers ſay they cannot apprehend, and it ſeems to them that every thing was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways as it is now.</p>
               <p>To know whether there is any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Truth in what they ſay, we muſt examin thoſe two ſorts of Beings, and ſee whether they contain any thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may ſuſpect that they are Eternal.
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59986:128"/>As to Spirits, we only know our own Souls well, and Unbelievers acknowledg no other. Now I ask of them whether they perceive any thing in their Minds, which induces them to ſuſpect that they are Eternal? 'Tis certain that there is no ſuch thing, unleſs they will ſay that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Weakneſs are Characters of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. If we examin Bodies, which are inferior to Spirits, becauſe they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Underſtanding, we ſhall ſee nothing in them neither, which may make one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are Eternal.</p>
               <p>There are but two things that can be conſider'd in this latter kind of Beings, <hi>viz.</hi> Matter and Form; and if neither of them affords us any reaſon to believe that they have always been, we cannot affirm it. As for the Matter of Bodies, 'tis but a Subſtance Extended, Solid, Diviſible, and capable of Motion, and all ſorts of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. That collection of Qualities, which makes up the Eſſence of all Bodies, as far as it is known to us, contains nothing that looks like Eternity. The notion of this Property, however it be conſider'd, cannot be found in that Collection. So that it cannot be affirm'd that the Matter of Bodies is Eternal.</p>
               <p>All that can be ſaid thereupon may be reduc'd to theſe two things. Firſt, That one cannot conceive how meer <hi>Extenſion</hi> had a Beginning; becauſe notwithſtanding
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:59986:128"/>all our endeavours to think upon the Time when God was alone, before Bodies were created, a ſimple and boundleſs Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion always offers it ſelf to the Mind. But a meer Extenſion, in which we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend no Solidity, is not a Body; as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the abovemention'd Definition of a Body. There is another manifeſt Proof of it, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe meer Extenſion is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible and Boundleſs, as we perceive it by trying to divide or put ſome bounds to it in our Mind; whereas all Bodies are Diviſible, and continu'd within Bounds. So that all that could be concluded from thence, is, that the Place of Bodies is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Unbelievers ſay that they cannot apprehend how ſuch a Subſtance as that of Bodies ſhould be <hi>produc'd out of Nothing,</hi> as the Chriſtians ſay. If <hi>to be created out of Nothing,</hi> ſignifi'd to have no preexiſtent Cauſe, and yet to begin to exiſt, I confeſs that would be altogether impoſſible. For ſuppoſing that nothing exiſts but a meer Extenſion, how can it be conceiv'd that a ſolid and diviſible Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhould be form'd in it? One might as well apprehend that all ſorts of Beaſts, Plants and Minerals may ſpring forth out of the Air, without any Productive Cauſe. But <hi>to be created out of Nothing,</hi> ſignifies to have a Cauſe, which contains in a more excellent manner the Proprieties which we
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:59986:129"/>ſee in the things created, beſides an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of others; from which Cauſe the things created have their Exiſtence, or by the Will whereof they begin actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to exiſt. There is nothing in all this that's contradictory; and if we do not clearly apprehend wherein the Action of the Cauſe, which creates out of nothing, conſiſts, 'tis becauſe the Nature of that Cauſe is not perfectly known to us.</p>
               <p>To explain what I have ſaid by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Example, no Man will deny that there is in Nature a Principle of Motion different from Matter, ſeeing we perceive that Matter moves not of it ſelf. All that we perceive in it, is <hi>Mobility,</hi> but it cannot be ſaid that we have any reaſon to believe that Matter moves and modifies it ſelf. This being ſo, the immaterial Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Motion, whatever it be, <hi>produces</hi> Motion in Matter <hi>out of nothing;</hi> that is to ſay, being able to move, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the imperfections of Actual Motion, he makes Motion to begin to exiſt in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which before was in the ſtate of Reſt. This is a Fact which cannot be doubted of, ſeeing Motion exiſts, and Matter is not the Cauſe of it. But 'tis not known how a Being uncapable of Motion, ſeeing it is not Material, can produce it in Matter. If any one ſhould ſay that Motion is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, becauſe he can't apprehend how it can have a Beginning; he might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59986:129"/>to Experience, which teaches us that we move our Arms and Feet when we pleaſe, after they have been at reſt, tho we don't know how it is done. I know ſome Philoſophers ſay, that we only determin the Actual Motion of the Animal Spirits, which move our Members as many ways as we pleaſe. I will not here confute that Conjecture, (for 'tis only a meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture) but I maintain that 'tis as difficult a thing to apprehend that an immaterial Being determines a Motion a certain way, as to apprehend that he produces it anew. So that if thoſe Philoſophers may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to affirm the one; or if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny it, tho they apprehend not how it comes to paſs; it would be a great piece of Injuſtice to find fault with thoſe that ſay there is an immaterial Principle which produc'd Motion in Matter, tho it is not known how he did it.</p>
               <p>This being undeniable, I conclude from it, that tho I have no diſtinct Idea of the Manner after which God may have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Bodies out of nothing, yet I can't deny it: eſpecially if we obſerve in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no Character of Eternity, 'tis an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd thing even to ſuſpect that it is Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; and much more abſurd ſtill to find fault with Chriſtian Divines, who ſay that it was created out of Nothing.</p>
               <p>Tho nothing can hinder us from grounding the Creation of the World up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59986:130"/>that Foundation; yet it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the Chriſtian Religion, which was inſtituted for illiterate Men, as well as for Scholars, do's not neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe ſorts of things which require a greater Meditation than the Vulgar is capable of. It's enough to apprehend that God imparted to Matter the Form it now has, to pay to him all the Duties which he requires from us in the Goſpel. So that, without ſuppoſing what I have prov'd concerning the Creation of the Matter of Bodies, we muſt inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is any Reaſon to believe that the Form they have is Eternal.</p>
               <p>There is nothing in the Form no more than in Matter, which can make us ſuſpect, that the World, as it is now, never had a Beginning. Tho we have not ſeen the Formation of the great Bodies that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round us, and not one Eye-witneſs has left a Relation of it; tho it ſeems that little or no ſenſible Alteration happens in the World in general; yet no Body can ſay for all that, that it has been the ſame from all Eternity; becauſe the World might have been fram'd before there was any Man upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>But beſides, we cannot ſay that the Form of the World is Eternal, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Men, and other Animals (which make a part of it) have always been up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; the perpetual Succeſſion, which
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59986:130"/>we ſee in their Kinds, do's plainly teach us, that they had a Beginning. It can't be ſaid that the Animals who live at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, are born of their Fathers and Mothers, and Theſe after the ſame manner, and ſo <hi>in infinitum,</hi> ſo as never to come to the firſt. The Reaſon of it is, becauſe Beings that have a limited Duration, as that of every Generation is, cannot equal Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by ſuch a Duration: as a number of limited Meaſures, tho never ſo great, cannot be equal to an infinite Extenſion. Every Generation ſingly taken having had a Beginning, we muſt neceſſarily come to the Beginning of thoſe Generations.</p>
               <p>'Tis therefore manifeſt, that Men and Beaſts began to exiſt upon Earth, and conſequently that they were form'd by ſome Cauſe. <hi>Epicurus,</hi> who ſaid that they were form'd by a fortuitous Concourſe of Atoms, made more ridiculous Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and more abſurd Conjectures, than what we find in the antient Fables. Hence it is that no body maintains his <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> now. But others ſay, that whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, is properly but one Being, that modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd it ſelf by a neceſſary Conſequence from its Nature. If any body knew what they mean, or if they knew it themſelves, they might be confuted; but an Opinion that is ſo abſurd and nonſenſical, tho it has the outward Appearance of a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Order, can deceive no body but
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59986:131"/>thoſe who will be deceiv'd, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to it from ſome other Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Wherefore ſeeing nothing can give a Beginning to it ſelf, it muſt be confeſs'd that there is a Being more excellent than all Animals, who form'd them upon this Earth; and this is that Being which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians call GOD: Thus they muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity acknowledg a God who has created us.</p>
               <p>'Tis an eaſy thing to prove that he created the Sun and the Planets; becauſe limited Periods, as thoſe of the Planets are, can never exhauſt Eternity, tho they be never ſo much multipli'd. So that we may very well ſay, <hi>that there is a Maker of Heaven and Earth;</hi> and no Objection can force us to renounce that Propoſition, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we directly prove it by undeniable Arguments; and the Objections that may be oppos'd to them do not deſtroy them, and are but the natural Effects of our Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>
               <p>They object, for example, That they cannot apprehend how God, who is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be immaterial, could create Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies out of nothing. <hi>None can give what he has not,</hi> ſay they; ſo that God being incorporeal, could not give to Bodies the Proprieties which they have. But it ought to be obſerv'd, that this very Argument will prove that there is no Motion in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for one may ſay, Matter has no
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59986:131"/>Motion of it ſelf; and that which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material has leſs ſtill: None can give what he has not; wherefore Matter has no Motion. Let them try to anſwer this Argument, and the Anſwer, if it be good, will reſolve the propos'd Objection againſt the Creation of Matter. It may be ſaid, that God contains the real Proprieties of all Beings, but without having the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Defects of them, ſeeing 'tis certain he has created them, and he is infinitely more perfect than all the Things to which he gave a Beginning. By this Argument we aſcend from the Effects to the Cauſe, but we don't learn by it, nor by any other Argument, how the real Proprieties of Creatures are in God, nor how he made them to exiſt. The Fact is as certain as the Manner of it is above hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Underſtanding, as well as the Origin of Motion, tho no body can doubt of its Exiſtence.</p>
               <p>There is another thing which the Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous will not believe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we ſay is contain'd <hi>in the Old and New Teſtament.</hi> Whatever they ſay concerning Revelation in general, is grounded upon this Prejudice, <hi>viz.</hi> that they themſelves having no Experience of a Revelation, they can't be perſwaded that there has been any. But nothing can be weaker than Arguments grounded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon our Ignorance, and which ſuppoſe
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:59986:132"/>that what we know not is not true, as I have already obſerv'd. Thoſe who deny Revelation, ſhould either manifeſtly prove that God cannot reveal himſelf to his Creatures after an extraordinary manner, which no body will ever be able to prove, or find out in that Revelation ſome mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Characters of Falſity, which no body can ſhew in the Revelation of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>This might be ſufficient to ſtop the Mouths of Unbelievers; but their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to believe the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ariſing partly from their being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Hiſtory thereof, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving how the Wiſdom of God appears in it, I ſhall ſet down that Hiſtory in a few Words.</p>
               <p>Men knowing nothing but by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Reflection; and Experience being ſlow, and Reflection often-times difficult, God ſhew'd them by ſome Revelations, from the Beginning of the World, what they ought to know concerning his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Worſhip he requir'd from them. Tho <hi>Moſes</hi> has given us but a ſhort Abridgment of the Hiſtory of what paſt during above two thouſand Years, before he receiv'd the Law of God; yet he mentions<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 3.3.9, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;</hi> 6.13. &amp; 7.1. &amp; 8.15. &amp; 9.1. &amp; 12.1, &amp;c.</note> ſeveral Revelations, and every where ſuppoſes that they were very frequent, as all thoſe who have read the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> know very well. But it
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:59986:132"/>appears that Men made not a very good Uſe of them. The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> one of the moſt antient and happy Nations in the World, were already in his time infected with a ſhameful Idolatry,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od. 8.16. &amp; 32.4.</note> which made them worſhip Beaſts. The <hi>Cananeans</hi> were alſo Idolaters, as he ſays<note n="†" place="margin">Lev. 20. 2. Numb. 25.3, &amp;c.</note> in many Places, and liv'd a very wicked Life. There is no likelihood that the other neighbouring Nations made a better Uſe of thoſe antient Revelations, or the Light of Reaſon, which God has given to all Men.</p>
               <p>So that there was not one Nation that could boaſt to have improv'd the Talents it receiv'd from Heaven, as it ought to do; and if God had given them up to their Darkneſs and Wickedneſs, none of them could have juſtly complain'd of him. Notwithſtanding, to paſs by the Nations whoſe Hiſtory is not well known to us, God being mov'd with Compaſſion towards Men, would not permit that Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and corrupt Manners ſhould, as it were, overflow the whole World. He continu'd to reveal himſelf more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Family of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Poſterity; and to make thoſe Revelations more uſeful, and hinder them from being corrupted by the Mixture of the falſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of other Nations, he order'd the Iſraelites to frame a Commonwealth by it ſelf, and forbad them to converſe much
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59986:133"/>with their Neighbours. To frame that Commonwealth, and enable it to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it ſelf till he ſhould think fit to call the other Nations to the ſame Knowledg the Hebrews had, he gave them ſome Laws, the Obſervation whereof he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd under moſt ſevere Penalties. There are ſeveral things to be obſerv'd in thoſe Laws, which may help us to ſee the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom contain'd in them; but it will ſuffice to ſay that ſome of them are grounded upon the very Conſtitution of Nature and humane Society; ſo that all Nations are bound to obſerve them, at leaſt in ſome meaſure, and that they cannot be violated without hurting the Society. They are call'd <hi>Moral Laws.</hi> The other do ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Commonwealth of the Hebrews in particular, that other Men are not the worſe for not obſerving them; and they are call'd <hi>Political Laws.</hi> Laſtly, the other concern the Ceremonies which God would have to be obſerv'd in his Worſhip. They are ſtil'd <hi>Ceremonial Laws.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt ſort of Laws, as thoſe which command to acknowledg a God, and to worſhip him, to honour our Parents, and to do to our Neighbour as we would be done by; that ſort of Laws, I ſay, was approv'd by the wiſeſt Heathen Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Philoſophers; and Jeſus Chriſt has ſince confirm'd them. The neceſſity of thoſe Laws can't be doubted of, ſeeing
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59986:133"/>they can't be neglected without feeling the diſmal Effects of that Neglect; and ſeeing the Nature of humane Society ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily requires the Obſervation of thoſe Laws, it can't be doubted but that they are worthy of him to whom humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture owes its Origin. Tho this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, it would be an eaſy thing to ſhew that ſeveral Nations had many Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them, becauſe the Intereſts and Paſſions of ſome private Men prevail'd above the publick Good. Leſt therefore the Light that was contrary to thoſe ill Cuſtoms ſhould be wholly extinguiſh'd among Men, it was neceſſary that there ſhould be at leaſt one Nation upon Earth, in which good and ſound Laws ſhould be ſo clearly and undeniably eſtabliſh'd, that no body could doubt of them. This we find among the Jews: God himſelf deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd part of thoſe Laws with his own Mouth, and acquainted them with the reſt by a Prophet whom he authoriz'd with Miracles.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Laws are, as I ſaid, equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at all times, and in all places, in order to the Peace and Happineſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society: but becauſe it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the Commonwealth of the Jews ſhould not be mix'd with other Nations, leſt thoſe Laws ſhould be deſtroy'd, God gave them ſome other Laws accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the <hi>Genius</hi> of that People, and to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59986:134"/>their State in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which they were to poſſeſs. Such are the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Ceremonial Laws; the chief Excellency of which conſiſts in having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is contrary to the Moral Laws and in being ſuted to the People who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them. One may eaſily perceive that the Political and Ceremonial Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> contain nothing that's contrary to the Moral ones: but to convince ones ſelf that God could give no Laws more ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the State and <hi>Genius</hi> of the Jews, one ought to have a competent Knowledg of the Manners of the Nations among which they had liv'd, and with which they were then ſurrounded. Thoſe who have appli'd themſelves to that Study, have found out that a great part of thoſe Laws were like thoſe of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nations, and that they were alſo<note n="‖" place="margin">See my <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> upon the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch.</hi>
                  </note> contrary to them in ſeveral things; ſo that it may be ſaid that God, accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating himſelf to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, took care ſo to diſtinguiſh the Form of their Commonwealth and Worſhip, from that of their Neighbours, that it was impoſſible they ſhould mix themſelves with them, as long as they ſhould obſerve thoſe Laws. I will not come to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of thoſe Facts, becauſe I have treated of them at large in the Latin Book which I juſt now quoted in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:59986:134"/>
               <p>As God had ſettl'd thoſe Laws chiefly by his Authority, or that of a Prophet authoriz'd with Miracles, ſo he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd the Obſervation of them, not only by the ordinary Magiſtrates who might themſelves neglect them in time, but alſo by ſeveral Prophets whom he ſent to the Jews from time to time to cenſure them for their Vices, and excite them to obey him by ſome Rewards and Puniſhments, which they preach'd in his Name.</p>
               <p>All the Laws that have relation to a certain State of a Nation, which makes them uſeful and neceſſary, do evidently ſuppoſe that they are only good, as long as that State laſts; and ſuch were the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical and Ceremonial Laws of the Jews. Notwithſtanding the Law-giver, who would give no body an occaſion of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Laws, on pretence that they were no longer neceſſary, and ſo of overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commonwealth of the Jews before the time, ſpeaks every-where of them as of <hi>eternal</hi> Laws. He kept to himſelf the Power of abrogating them when the time ſhould come, leſt the Jews ſhould do it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably, and atter a manner contrary to his Intention.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Prophets whom he ſent to keep the Jews to their Duty, or to bring them to it, were order'd to ſay ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, which by degrees diſpos'd that People to what was to happen ſome time
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:59986:135"/>or other, that is, to ſee themſelves mix'd with all the other Nations, and to obſerve only ſuch Laws as are of an eternal Uſe, and grounded on the Conſtitution of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature. For example, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was commanded to ſay to the Jews of his time;<note n="*" place="margin">Ch. 31.31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, that I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and with the Houſe of</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah: <hi>not according to the Covenant which I made with their Fathers in the day that I took them by the Hand to bring them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt—<hi>But this ſhall be the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that I will make with the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>After thoſe Days I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts;</hi> (that is, it will be of ſuch a Nature that Reaſon only will almoſt teach it, and they will eaſily remember it) <hi>and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People: And they ſhall teach no more every Man his Neighbour, and every Man his Brother, Know the Lord; for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them,</hi> &amp;c. This clearly denotes ſome new Laws, which one might eaſily learn and remember; whereas it was not ſo with the Ceremonial Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which can neither be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remembr'd nor underſtood.

               </p>
               <p>There are alſo ſome Promiſes in the Prophets concerning him whom God was to ſend to inſtruct the Jews more clearly in his laſt Intention, as in the 53d Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Ifaiah,</hi> wherein God fays, amongſt other things; <hi>By his Knowledg ſhall my righteous Servant juſtify many, and he ſhall bear their Iniquities.</hi> Elſewhere he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a King:<note n="*" place="margin">Mich. 5.2. <hi>See</hi> Zech. 9.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou</hi> Bethlehem E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phratah, <hi>tho thou be little among the thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of</hi> Judah, <hi>yet out of thee ſhall he come forth unto me, that is to be Ruler in</hi> Iſrael. Tho it is no eaſy thing to prove now to the Jews or others, by ſome grammatical Arguments, that thoſe Paſſages, and the like, concern the Deliverer who was promis'd to the Iſraelites; yet it appears by the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and their moſt antient Teachers, that the Jews un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood then the Prophecies in that Senſe. It was a general Opinion that a King was to come, (whom they named <hi>Meſſiah</hi> by Excellency, that is to ſay <hi>Anointed,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Kings were anointed) and that he wou'd change the State of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> But neither the Words of the Prophets, nor what Tradition might have preſerv'd of their Doctrine, were clear enough to give them a diſtinct and true Notion of the Perſon of that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59986:136"/>King, or the Nature of his Kingdom. Hence it is that they expected a King like thoſe whom they had formerly, who ſhould ſubdue their Neighbours to their Empire.</p>
               <p>There are many ſuch Promiſes in the Prophets which I will not inſiſt upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome few Examples will be ſufficient to ſhew the Deſign of the Revelation, and the Effect it wrought in the Minds of the People. The Jews having had ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets when they return'd from the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> had none ſince, at leaſt that we know of, to the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which was the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Divine Wiſdom, to ſend not only to the Jews, but to all Mankind, a new Law-giver, to inſtruct them more fully in the Knowledg of their Duty.</p>
               <p>I muſt ſomewhat inſiſt upon this Place, to ſhew God's Wiſdom in the Choice of the Time wherein he ſent Chriſt to the World. The Jews ſtood no more in need of ſuch Prophets as the foregoing were, to require from them the Obſervation of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and cenſure their Vices. The Writings of the antient Prophets, which they read then more carefully than ever they did, were ſufficient for that. There was no need neither to make fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promiſes of a Meſſiah by new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; they thought they perceiv'd him clearly enough in the Old. But they ſtood
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:59986:136"/>in great need of two things. The one was to learn that the true Worſhip of God do's not conſiſt in Ceremonies, but in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining noble Thoughts of God, and in praying to, and truſting in him, and in loving one's Neighbour as himſelf. It ought to be obſerv'd that by the word <hi>Neighbour</hi> we muſt underſtand all Men in general. The other thing the Jews want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then, was to know certainly that there is a future Life, and that God will reward good Men, and puniſh the Wicked after this Life.</p>
               <p>The Jews entertain'd a moſt pernicious Error concerning the firſt thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Obſervation of the Ceremonies was the chief thing Men could do to be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, whereas thoſe Ceremonies were but ſome Laws which God had giv'n them out of Condeſcenſion, and to keep them ſeparate from other Nations, until a certain time; as it appears from the thing it ſelf, and Experience. Beſides, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans being then ready to deprive them of a ſmall Remainder of Liberty which they enjoy'd, and to take from them the Means of preſerving their Temple, it was very neceſſary that the Jews ſhould know that it was no great Loſs, ſeeing they would be no leſs acceptable to God, by worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping him only, and obeying his Moral Laws, tho they ſhould obſerve no longer the Ceremonial ones. Foraſmuch as they
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59986:137"/>were to be mix'd for ever with all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their Commonweath being deſtroy'd without any hope of a Re-eſtabliſhment; one of the moſt uſeful Advices that could be giv'n them, was to look upon all Men as their <hi>Neighbours.</hi> They were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den before to converſe familiarly with them, as long as the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould ſubſiſt; but after its total Deſtruction there was no room left for that Diſtinction; nay, it was impoſſible. The Re-union of the Jews with the reſt of Mankind was moſt worthy of God, the common Father of all Men, who had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated his Children for a time, leſt a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Corruption ſhould overflow them.</p>
               <p>As for what concerns a future Life, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with its Rewards and Puniſhments, it was altogether neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould ground that Belief upon a new Foundation. The Prophets ſpoke not clearly enough upon that Point, and it can't be found in their Writings but by the help of ſeveral Conſequences, and thoſe ſometimes extremely nice. That Doctrine is not expreſly treated of there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and there is nothing concerning it where any would think it ſhould be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dl'd at large, and in expreſs Words, as in that Part of the Law wherein Rewards are promis'd to thoſe who ſhall obey God, and Puniſhments denounc'd againſt thoſe who ſhall break his Commandments.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59986:137"/>Hence it is that the <hi>Sadduces</hi> laugh'd at that Doctrine, and pretended it was a vain Tradition. Yet 'tis certain that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion runs a great Danger without this Doctrine, which is undoubtedly always neceſſary to excite Men to the Practice of Vertue, as I could eaſily ſhew; but it was eſpecially neceſſary to the Jews at that time. The Perſecutions of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or their own Diſſenſions, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd them to a miſerable Condition, and the temporal Promiſes of the Law were no more fulfill'd. Which made even good Men murmur, and the learn'd Men of that time were not at all able to hinder it, as it appears from the Authors of the <hi>Wiſdom of</hi> Solomon <hi>and</hi> Eccleſiaſticus, who are ſtrangely perplex'd with this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>ch.</hi> 4, &amp; 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Why wicked Men are often very happy in this Life, and thoſe that keep the Law very miſerable?</hi> That Queſtion could not be otherways anſwer'd, than by ſaying, that God being not willing that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould laſt longer, ceas'd to grant to the Obſervers of his Laws the Rewards he had promis'd them; and that calling them now to a more ſublime Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, he would grant them in another Life an infinitely more excellent Reward than the temporal Happineſs they wiſh'd for.</p>
               <p>'Tis true that the Phariſees aſſerted the Reſurrection of the Dead, and an eternal Life, but it ſeems they grounded their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:59986:138"/>more upon Tradition than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Words of Scripture. Nay, they ſpake of another Life as the Heathens did, if we believe<note n="*" place="margin">Ant. Jud. lib. 18. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Joſephus.</hi> To build ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Doctrine upon a ſolid Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing leſs could be requir'd than the Authority of the Meſſiah, who very clearly teaches it every-where, and was himſelf a ſenſible Example of what God will do for good Men: which made one of his Apoſtles ſay,<note n="†" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>that he has brought Life and Immortality to Light through the Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It appears from what has been ſaid, how neceſſary it was that Chriſt ſhould be born among the Jews at that very time, and how neceſſary and uſeful his Doctrine was to them. But perhaps it will be ask'd, why there was no Reaſon then to fear the Jews would corrupt themſelves among the Pagans, as they did formerly? The Reaſon of it is, becauſe the Belief of the Unity of a God, Maker of Heaven and Earth, and his Spirituality, were ſo rooted in the Minds of the Jews, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could perſwade them to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hereafter. The Jews were better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifi'd, and more like to convert the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, than the Heathens to draw the Jews to their Opinions, tho they had the uppermoſt. The moſt celebrated Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers among the <hi>Grecians</hi> believ'd the Unity of a ſupreme God; and the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59986:138"/>of the <hi>Mob,</hi> which was built upon Fables, was not at all approv'd by Men of Senſe, as may be eaſily prov'd. So that the Jews ran not ſo great a danger, in that reſpect, as they did before. Beſides, it was none of the <hi>Romans</hi> Maxims to make Proſelytes, as the Jews did; ſo that they endeavour'd not, at leaſt commonly, to make them embrace their Opinions, either by cunning Arts, or by Force. They to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated them every-where, provided they would obey the Laws which were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to their Religion.</p>
               <p>Beſides, God, who was making every thing ready to call the Gentiles to his Knowledg, was ſhortly to form a great People in the midſt of Paganiſm, with whom the Jews might live without any danger of corrupting themſelves. But it will be ask'd, Why God ſtaid ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he manifeſted himſelf to the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens? Perhaps what I ſaid juſt now, is one Reaſon of it, <hi>viz.</hi> leſt the Jews being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to live amongſt them, ſhould altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupt themſelves, if Heatheniſm ſhould prevail every-where. But beſides, it may be ſaid that the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were never better qualifi'd to receive the Goſpel. The Study of Philoſophy had in ſome meaſure deliver'd them from the Ignorance and Superſtition they lay under during many Ages; and the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the Romans, who were not very
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59986:139"/>well perſwaded of the Truth of their Anceſtors Religion, did not allow them to mind whatever might be ſaid againſt their Gods. The Jews and Chriſtians have not more rail'd at them than the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans, as it appears by the Example of <hi>Lucian.</hi> Tho the Diſcourſes of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureans aroſe from a Principle of Atheiſm, altogether contrary to the Diſpoſition of the Jews and Chriſtians, yet they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted much to facilitate the Belief of the Chriſtian Religion, becauſe the Epicure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans knew very well how to deſtroy the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Religion, but had no better Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to eſtabliſh in its ſtead; whereas the Jews and Chriſtians had a very rational Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem to ſupply the room of the Heatheniſh Errors. Thus God, who can draw Light out of Darkneſs, made uſe of the Effect the Epicurean Philoſophy had wrought, to introduce his Knowledg more eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens.</p>
               <p>The moſt civiliz'd and frequented Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia</hi> being at that time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one and the ſame Empire, and under ſome Laws that were juſt enough; the Peace which was then more general than it had been before, and the Safety where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Men might travel thro' the Roman Empire, did very much contribute to the Propagation of the Chriſtian Doctrine; ſo that it may be ſaid, that if God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to have Compaſſion on the Heathens,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59986:139"/>it was then the time, or never, to call them to his Knowledg.</p>
               <p>During thoſe Circumſtances, which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Reader to recal to his Mind, God was pleas'd that a Law-giver ſhould be born among the Jews, of another Nature than he whom they expected, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more uſeful to them. Inſtead of a temporal King, who might have increas'd their Power and Renown, but would not have leſſen'd their Ignorance nor their Vices; God ſent them a King worthy of him who taught them how they ought to live here, to be eternally happy after this Life; and ſhew'd them, that inſtead of being Members of a little Commonwealth, and Enemies to the reſt of Mankind, they ought to look upon the whole World as their native Countrey, and all Men as their Fellow-Citizens; a Thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of thoſe who already profeſs'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all Men are equally the Work of God.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe Pagans who were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with their own Religion, they made uſe in vain of the Light of their Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, to find out ſomething better, when Chriſtianity happily offer'd it ſelf to them, to free them from their Doubts. There was a general Corruption among them, proceeding from ſome having no Religion, and others ridiculous ones. 'Tis true that the Philoſophers oppos'd that Corruption
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59986:140"/>in ſome meaſure: but ſome of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted Men to Vertue only as much as it was neceſſary for them in this Life, as the <hi>Epicurcans</hi> which took off all the Force of their Diſcourſes; others, as the <hi>Platonicks</hi> and <hi>Stoicks,</hi> mention'd indeed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which may be expected after Death, but only in a doubtful manner, and without any Proof; ſo that their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations were in effect very weak. Tho their Morals were fine indeed, yet there were ſeveral things in them to be found fault with, and their Theology was full of <hi>Chimeras,</hi> which now I will not inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Then the Chriſtian Religion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd with a Theology altogether agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Light of Reaſon, with ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Syſtem of Morals, that it contains whatever the ſeveral Sects of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſaid, that was good, upon that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and with Rewards and Puniſhments ſo certain, that Men are neceſſarily mov'd with them when they think of them. It muſt be confeſs'd that God could reveal nothing to Men that was more ſutable to their needs, nor enlighten them in a more proper time.</p>
               <p>It appears from thence that God had very good Reaſons to manifeſt himſelf to the Jews and Heathens, as I have ſaid. Not that I will affirm that thoſe are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely the Reaſons of the Conduct of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and that it had no other. My
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59986:140"/>Deſign was only to make it appear that 'tis a very eaſy thing to ſhew the Wiſdom thereof, and to ſtop the Mouths of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; for if Men, notwithſtanding their Ignorance, can give very probable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of God's Conduct, how great a Light might he dart into our Minds, if he were pleas'd to draw off the Vail, if I may ſpeak ſo, under which he hides himſelf?</p>
               <p>I muſt make ſome more Obſervations upon the Perſons whom he made uſe of to manifeſt himſelf to Men, becauſe Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers fancy that they ſhould have been quite other Men than they were. They think that if God deſign'd to ſend any in his Name to Men, he ſhould have choſen Men of Authority, to keep them in awe; and eloquent enough to excite the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, and write according to all the Rules of Eloquence what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to leave to Poſterity.</p>
               <p>I confeſs that moſt of thoſe whoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry God made uſe of to reveal his Will to Men, were not at all Perſons of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The Goſpel it ſelf, which is his laſt Revelation, was preach'd only by mean and ordinary Men, without any Dignity in the Commonwealth of the Jews. But I maintain that there are ſenſible Marks of God's Wiſdom in that Choice, which could not appear in a contrary Choice. I will only ſpeak of the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel, becauſe what I ſhall ſay of them
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59986:141"/>may be eaſily appli'd to the Prophets of the Old Teſtament, who were Men of the ſame Condition.</p>
               <p>Tho Chriſt was born of a Royal Line, his Family was become ſo poor, that he could make no great Figure among the Jews upon the ſcore of his Extraction. Moſt of his Apoſtles were Fiſhermen, or Men of no greater Account: So that they had no Authority among their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whereby they might command any Reſpect. But that which ſeem'd proper to expoſe them to Contempt was the only thing that could authorize their Doctrine, eſpecially in future Ages. To be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of it, let us ſuppoſe the contrary a little, and ſee what would be thought of it. If Chriſt and his Apoſtles had been Men of Authority, it might be ſaid, with great ſhew of Reaſon, Firſt, that they were Men of great Parts, who ſeeing the Jews in ſuch a Corruption, which altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtroy'd the Civil Society amongſt them, as we learn from the Hiſtory of that time, undertook to reform them, by feigning new Revelations, and authorizing theſe pretended Revelations by falſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. 'Tis a Deſign that Men of the firſt Rank may eaſily think of, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have been accus'd of it, as <hi>Lycurgus, Numa</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch <hi>in their Lives:</hi> Diodorus Siculus, Bibl. lib. 1. <hi>towards the end.</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantius Inſt. Div. lib. 1. <hi>c.</hi> 22.</note>, and other Pagan Law-givers, who feign'd to have receiv'd their Laws from ſome Deity, to make them more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59986:141"/>Secondly, it might be ſaid, that by giving better Laws to their Fellow-Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, as being come from Heaven, they not only did them good Service in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving them, but alſo that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves got Credit by it, becauſe they were look'd upon as Miniſters of the Godhead. Thirdly, it would be ſaid that their Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were falſe, becauſe Men of Authority and Power may eaſily deceive others, by appointing ſome Men who favour their Deſign, and frighting by their Authority thoſe who could diſcover their Cheats. 'Twas, for example, an eaſy thing for <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> to pretend that he had a particular Acquaintance with the Nimph <hi>Egeria,</hi> and perſwade the Romans that he went to ſee that Goddeſs every Night in a Wood, wherein he might eaſily hide ſome body who made them believe, by a thouſand Cheats which may eaſily come into one's Mind, that this Wood was the Reſidence of the Goddeſs. He might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoſe who favour'd his Deſign, and revenge himſelf of thoſe who ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to croſs it. So that it muſt be confeſs'd that Men of Authority preaching a new Revelation, might have been ſo much ſuſpected by their Contemporaries, and eſpecially by Poſterity, that it would have been a very difficult thing, to aſſure one's ſelf of their Sincerity.</p>

               <p>On the contrary, 'tis manifeſt, that ſuch a Deſign of reforming the Jewiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and even all Mankind, by feigning a falſe Revelation, could not eaſily come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mind of Men who had no Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So vaſt a Project is not for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Men, who ſeldom entertain great Thoughts; and the Danger of being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd and puniſh'd by the Magiſtrates is more than ſufficient to deter them from doing it, if they had any ſuch Thoughts. They would be ſo far from hoping with any probability to get more Credit and Authority by ſuch a Cheat, that they would be afraid of being diſcover'd by their Superiours, who always ſuſpect ſuch Deſigns. Laſtly, Such Men can promiſe no Rewards to thoſe who aſſiſt them, nor threaten thoſe that croſs their Deſigns of revenging themſelves upon them. Their Superiours watch over their Actions, and won't allow them to meddle with any thing that is out of their Sphere, and will be ſure to puniſh them upon the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they make. 'Tis therefore much more likely that Men of no Authority may act ſincerely on ſuch an occaſion, than thoſe of the firſt Rank. But there was nothing more neceſſary for all future Ages than to chuſe for the Preaching of the Goſpel, Men whoſe Honeſty could not be ſuſpected, ſeeing 'tis only upon their Sincerity that all our Belief is grounded.</p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:59986:142"/>
               <p>And beſides, the Succeſs of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel by Men of no Authority, is a plain Evidence of the Finger of God, and the Strength of the Apoſtles Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whereas the Succeſs of a Deſign contriv'd and put in execution by conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Men, would be look'd upon as an Effect of their Authority, rather than of their Reaſons.<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 1.27, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>God has choſen,</hi> ſays one of Chriſt's Apoſtles, <hi>the fooliſh things of the World to confound the Wiſe: and God has choſen the weak things of the World to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the things which are mighty: and baſe things of the World, and things which are deſpis'd has God choſen; yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are, that no Fleſh ſhould glory in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the Art and Eloquence which Unbelievers would require in the Writings of the Apoſtles, to believe that they are inſpir'd: but I affirm again, that that very thing would raiſe Suſpicions againſt them, and Doubts concerning the Truth of their Doctrine. Before I ſhew it, I muſt not forget to ſay, that I don't blame Art and Eloquence as being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and uſeleſs on all occaſions. On the contrary, thoſe that make a good uſe of it, can't be too much eſteem'd, that is, thoſe who uſe it to vindicate and clear Truth, or to lead Men to Vertue. I only deſign to ſhew that it fell out better that
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:59986:143"/>the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of it.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe again the contrary of what happen'd; and that the Apoſtles who left to Poſterity the Life, Diſcourſes and Doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt, were Men of great Eloquence, and perfect Maſters of the Art of Writing exactly and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically. Let us ſuppoſe that their Writings as well as their Diſcourſes were compos'd with great Exactneſs, and all poſſible Elegancy; I'll tell you the Effect it would work upon the Minds of Men, eſpecially of thoſe who ſhould read them now. They would think that they were very ingenious Men, whoſe Learning and Eloquence had mov'd them to propagate their Doctrine through the whole World, and get Reputation by it; as it can't be doubted that 'twas <hi>Plato</hi>'s Deſign as well as of many other Philoſophers. It would be ſaid that thoſe Men, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince others not only of the Excellency of their Morals, by the Eloquence of their Writings, but alſo to make them obſerve ſo excellent a Doctrine, out of a more powerful Motive, contriv'd all the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles contain'd in the Life of Chriſt. The more exact they had been in obſerving the Circumſtances of Time, Places, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; the more careful they had been to ſet off the wonderful Parts of that incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Life, and the Beauty of their
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:59986:143"/>Maſter's Thoughts, by their manner of expreſſing them, the more they would have been ſuſpected of Artifice, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the following Ages, when what they ſaid of Chriſt would be the only Reaſon of believing in him. Thus <hi>Plato</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert. lib. 3. §. 3. &amp; Intt. in h. loc.</note> was ſuſpected to have adorn'd the Diſcourſes of <hi>Socrates</hi> his Maſter; nay it has been ſaid, that he ſent him ſome of his own Thoughts, as thoſe who have any Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Maſter and his Diſciple can't doubt of it.</p>
               <p>The Succeſs of the Goſpel, which is no inconſiderable Mark of its Divinity, would be look'd upon as the Effect of the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of its firſt Preachers, not of an extraordinary Providence. It would have been ſaid at moſt, that the Doctrine of the Apoſtles was the moſt excellent and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Philoſophy that had been taught till that time. But by granting the Truth of their moral Rules, they would have doubted of its Divinity, and look'd upon it rather as the effect of the Apoſtles Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, than a Divine Revelation.</p>
               <p>But having written the Life of their Maſter, and publiſh'd his Diſcourſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Art or Method, they can't be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected neither to have contriv'd what they ſaid, nor to have us'd any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to make a Lie look with the Air of Truth. Their great Simplicity, which appears every where, and their taking no
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:59986:144"/>care to impoſe upon the Reader, are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Marks not only of their being not able to deceive, but alſo of their Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The wonderful Succeſs of their Preaching, tho deſtitute of whatever rais'd the Admiration of the Orators and Philoſophers, is a convincing Proof of their being favour'd by Heaven.<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>My Speech and my Preaching,</hi> ſays one of them, <hi>was not with enticing Words of Mens Wiſdom, but in Demonſtration of the Spirit and of Power,</hi> (to wit, in the Miracles) <hi>that your Faith ſhould not ſtand in the Wiſdom of Men, but in the Power of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we reflect upon thoſe Circumſtances of the Revelation, and all the other, which at firſt ſeem to make one doubt of it, when they are not throughly examin'd, we ſhall ſee that God could not give more ſenſible Marks of the Care he took about it, but by chuſing thoſe whoſe Miniſtry he made uſe of to propagate it through the whole World.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not undertake to reſolve the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Objections which Unbelievers may raiſe againſt the Chriſtian Religion: the Anſwer to which muſt be look'd for in the Writings of thoſe who have directly prov'd the Truth of it, or written upon the Holy Scripture.</p>

               <head>The <hi>CONCLUSION</hi> of the Second Part.</head>
               <p>I Think I may conclude now (nor can Unbelievers accuſe me of drawing a Conſequence that extends farther than the Proofs I made uſe of) that nothing can be more falſe than to fancy that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is grounded upon mere Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity: That the Ignorance or corrupt Manners of thoſe who profeſs it, ought not to prejudice it in the leaſt: That tho many profeſs it out of Intereſt for many Ages paſt, rather than out of Perſwaſion, no ſuch thing can be ſuſpected concerning its firſt Founders: That the Diviſions which are among Chriſtians ought not to make one doubt of the Truth of it: That the Goſpel is very uſeful to the greateſt part of Mankind, both in this Life and the next: That the Falſities which are to be found in the Doctrine of ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans now, muſt not be aſcrib'd to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Laſtly, That the Hiſtory of the Creation of the World, and of God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to Men, ſuch as the Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it, contains nothing but what is moſt agreeable to Reaſon, and moſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Wiſdom of the Maker of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth.</p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:59986:145"/>
               <p>If Unbelievers would ſeriouſly think upon what I have ſaid concerning thoſe Propoſitions, I am perſwaded that they would eaſily grant them; and then they might find, without any difficulty, an Anſwer to all their particular Objections. As ſoon as ſome undeniable Principles have been laid down, which influence all the Parts of the Chriſtian Theology, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things, which before ſeem'd diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, ceaſe then to be ſo; and thus one's Knowledg may be encreas'd every day. On the contrary, the general Principles of Religion remaining uncertain or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, every thing makes Men perplex'd, and the longer they live in ſuch a State, the more the Difficulties encreaſe. As ſoon as Men have learn'd to diſtinguiſh the Religion of Chriſt and his Apoſtles from what is taught in ſeveral Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Maxims of the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Chriſtianity, from thoſe of many Chriſtians of this time; they may eaſily perceive that a great Part of the Doctrines which they were offended at, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour which they diſlike, are not at all like the Doctrine of antient Chriſtianity, or the Manners of the Primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>The thing we treat of is not a Diſpute, wherein Men only deſign to ſhew their Wit, and get the Victory, but the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is about the Search of a Truth, the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59986:145"/>Knowledg whereof is equally uſeful to both Sides: Unbelievers ought therefore to part altogether with that Spirit of Wrangling, which makes them ſo eager to find fault, as if they were ſorry to be convinc'd that the Chriſtian Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing that claſhes with right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. On the contrary, they ſhould be diſpos'd as thoſe who ſearch a Truth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to them, and think rather to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it themſelves, than to find ſome Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities in the Doctrine of thoſe who would lead them to it, and to whom it is not perhaps well known. If thoſe to whom they make their Application to reſolve their Doubts, do not ſatisfy them, they ought to apply themſelves to the Divines, or read the Writings of another Party, which perhaps will afford them greater Satisfaction. Nay, if no body did alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſatisfy them, they would not be leſs bound to ſeek the Truth; and having known it in part, they ſhould endeavour to go farther, if it were poſſible, and take care not to part with what ſeem'd to them certain, becauſe they are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of the reſt.</p>
               <p>This common Senſe would require from Unbelievers, if Chriſtianity was now in ſo deplorable a Condition, that of all the Sects whereof it is made up, none knew it in its whole Extent, or could defend it as they ought. But Thanks be to God
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59986:146"/>we are not reduc'd to that Extremity. The Method of Reaſoning about Religion, as about all other things, and the manner of explaining the Holy Scripture, were brought in the laſt Century, and in this, by ſome Chriſtians, to ſuch a degree of Perfection, as they never attain'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Thoſe who liv'd in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity had reaſon to thank God for ſhewing them clear a living Proofs of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion by the Miracles that were wrought in the ſight of all Men, and the exact Knowledg they had of the Hiſtory of its firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. If we have not the ſame Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, we have at leaſt reaſon to give him our Thanks for teaching us that tho the Chriſtian Religion was founded without much Reaſoning or Eloquence, for the Reaſons I have alledg'd, yet the more we are able to reaſon well, the better we may be convinc'd of it; and that the Art of Writing according to the Rules ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on Reaſon, may be of great Uſe to ſet all the Beauties of the Chriſtian Religion in their due Light. The Suſpicions which thoſe Talents might have rais'd concerning its firſt Founders, have no room left with reſpect to thoſe who write now. There can be no better Service done to Religion than by enquiring into its Proofs with all the Exactneſs that we are capable of, and ſetting before the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59986:146"/>Eyes of the Reader what has been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, with all the Ornaments of true Eloquence Thoſe who know the Hiſtory of paſt Ages, are not ignorant that in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them falſe Reaſonings and great Ignorance were the beſt Talents of the Interpreters of Religion; ſo that a Man who read them, was almoſt to part with Reaſon and common Senſe. God be thank'd we are no more in ſuch a Darkneſs! May the encreaſe more and more the Light we enjoy by his Grace!</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>WHEN I began the foregoing Diſcourſe, I thought it not neceſſary to add any</hi> direct <hi>Proofs of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion: But, as I went on, I perceiv'd that this Work would not be compleat enough, if I prov'd it not at leaſt in few Words. What I have ſaid concerning Incredulity, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd only to remove the general Obſtacles which hinder the Incredulous from believing it to be true, it would ſeem that I was contented to make part of that Way ſmooth which may lead them to Heaven, without caring to guide them to the End of it. Therefore I thought my ſelf oblig'd to add theſe two Letters, one of which was publiſh'd about ten Years ago, but it will be found here larger, more correct, and in a better Order than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. As for the other, 'tis almoſt but an Extract, by way of a Letter, of a Chapter of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:59986:147"/>a Latin Book, wherein I have treated of the</hi> Nature of Spirits, <hi>which was made publick above theſe three Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <div n="1" type="letter">
               <head>
                  <hi>LETTER I.</hi> Wherein is prov'd the Sincerity of the Apoſtles in the Teſtimony they bore to the Reſurrection of Chriſt.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SIR, You deſire that I prove to you in few Words the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, that you may uſe my Proofs to cure ſome Gentlemen of your Acquaintance, who are fall'n into Infidelity. I could refer you to others who have ſucceſsfully treated of that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but becauſe moſt of them have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd very much upon it, I'll endeavour to tell you more briefly what I think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to convince your Friends of the Truth of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>The moſt common Reproach Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers caſt upon us, is, that we are full of Prejudices, which hinder us from unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving our ſelves. We ſay the ſame thing of them, and we affirm that 'tis commonly their ill Diſpoſition which raiſes ſome Difficulties in their Minds, which otherwiſe they would not ſo much
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59986:148"/>as think of. Beſides, we upbraid them with ſuppoſing a thouſand uncertain things in their Reaſonings, as if they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and they fail not in their turn to accuſe us of the ſame Fault. 'Tis not juſt that either of us ſhould ſuppoſe our Prejudices as Principles that are either demonſtrated, or that want no Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. Let us therefore act on both ſides, as if we had embrac'd no Party, and let us ſay nothing but what is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſome Principles granted on both ſides.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis granted on all hands, that there are certain Characters whereby we may often know whether a Fact be true or not, and diſtinguiſh a falſe Hiſtory from a true one. If this was not granted, Men muſt be <hi>Scepticks,</hi> or rather mad Men; for one can't, without being ſtark mad, doubt of the Truth of all Hiſtories. But another thing muſt be alſo granted, which is not leſs certain, <hi>viz.</hi> that to know the Truth or Falſity of a Fact, ſeveral Circumſtances of Things, Time, Places and Perſons, muſt be preſent to the Mind, without which one can't judg ſolidly of that Fact, and by which one may moſt certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin whether it be true or falſe. Thoſe who know thoſe Circumſtances, and have examin'd them at their leiſure, may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly give their Judgment about the Facts in queſtion; but they can't convince
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59986:148"/>others, without having inſtructed them before, and convinc'd them of the ſame Circumſtances: For example, thoſe who have read the Roman Hiſtory cannot doubt whether there was a <hi>Julius Ceſar,</hi> who made himſelf Maſter of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, becauſe the Multitude of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Hiſtorians, and of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, who atteſt the ſame thing, the <hi>Series</hi> of the Time and Hiſtory, Inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Medals, and the Air of Sincerity which is to be perceiv'd in all thoſe things, do not allow them to doubt of it. But if a Man was ignorant of all theſe Reaſons which we have to believe the Facts I have mention'd, and would doubt of them, it would be impoſſible to free him from his Doubt, without inſtructing him in all thoſe Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>The Divinity of the Chriſtian Religion being eſtabliſh'd upon ſome Facts, one can't judg of it neither but by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Circumſtances which attend them. Wherefore thoſe who deſire it ſhould be prov'd to them, without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with thoſe Circumſtances, require a thing equally unjuſt and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. What I have ſaid concerning <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi> can't be prov'd to a Man altogether ignorant of the Roman Hiſtory, whilſt he remains in that Ignorance; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently 'twould be unjuſt to require any ſuch thing with reſpect to Religion.</p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:59986:149"/>
               <p n="3">3. The firſt thing therefore that ought to be done, to prove the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, is to ſet down the Facts it ſuppoſes, with all their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: but an Objection offers it ſelf, which muſt be reſolv'd before. They ask what are the Doctrines of that Religion, for the Chriſtians have great Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among themſelves about their Belief. But our buſineſs is not to prove the private Opinions of any Party of Chriſtianity. 'Tis enough to ſhew, that the Doctrines about which all Chriſtians agree are true, by proving the Truth of ſome Facts, about which they agree too. Thoſe who are ſure of the Truth of its Doctrines and Facts, may, if they will, afterwards exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min all the Controverſies they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Therefore without undertaking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide thoſe Matters, I begin with the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Goſpel-Morals,<note n="*" place="margin">See are Abridgment of them in <hi>ch. 1.</hi> of <hi>Part 1.</hi>
                  </note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming to any Particulars. It can't be deni'd, that if all Men liv'd according to its Precepts, and by reaſon of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Puniſhments of another Life were careful to worſhip the Creator of the World; to live with Modeſty, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Sobriety and Patience; and to deal with their Neighbours as they would be dealt by them; it can't be deni'd, I ſay, that ſuch a Life would be moſt pleaſant and advantageous to human Society. We ſhould not ſee a thouſand impious Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59986:149"/>and ſo many Superſtitions, which have very diſmal Conſequences, as we ſee among Idolatrous Nations. The exceſſive Love of Dignities, Riches and Pleaſures, would not be the Cauſe of any Diſorder, and would be attended with no publick or private Sorrows. Men ſhould not know what it was to wrong their Neighbours, or ſuffer any Trouble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of others Inhumanity or Malice. They would help one another in all their Needs, with all the Ardour and Eagerneſs that can be wiſh'd for. If they ſhould happen to give one another any Trouble, without any premeditated Deſign, they would forgive one another, and make amends for it by all ſorts of good Services. Laſtly, the Mind enjoying a perfect Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and the Body being as healthful as its natural Weakneſs can allow, and both enjoying the harmleſs Pleaſures which the Goſpel allows us, Men would not part with ſo pleaſant a Life, but to enjoy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that would be free for ever from the unavoidable Inconveniencies to which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has made thoſe liable who live upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Such as have any Notion of the Morals of Chriſt, will neceſſarily grant this Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that Men would be moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py if they obſerv'd them all alike. It will perhaps be ask'd, whether any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Society does it? But that is not a
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59986:150"/>proper Queſtion; 'tis enough if it be granted that a Doctrine which can work ſo admirable Effects, muſt needs make one entertain favourable Thoughts of thoſe who preach'd it at firſt. We can't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear admiring thoſe who firſt exhorted Men to live one with another after a manner ſo agreeable to Reaſon, ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to Society, and ſo pleaſant and charming, that nothing can be preferr'd to it but the ſupreme Happineſs, which can't be enjoy'd but in an endleſs Life.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To know when that Doctrine was brought into the World, and by whom, we need only examin from Age to Age the Authors who ſpoke of it, by aſcending from ours to that wherein Chriſtianity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt to be known. We ſhall learn from thence, or from the reading of ſome Hiſtory, that above thirteen hundred Years paſt the Roman Emperors having embrac'd the Chriſtian Religion, it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in a great part of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> We may be convinc'd by a great number of Chriſtian Authors, that from that time they profeſs'd to believe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the Goſpel-Morals. If we go higher ſtill, we ſhall find by the reading of Heathen and Chriſtian Authors, that there was already a great multitude of Chriſtians under thoſe Emperors, who taught the ſame Doctrine. All thoſe who ſpake of the Origin of Chriſtianity grant
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59986:150"/>it began under the Empire of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and that it was not heard of before. <hi>Tacitus</hi> who was born towards the end of the Empire of <hi>Claudius,</hi> or in the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi>'s, ſays that <hi>Nero</hi> having ſet on fire ſeveral Parts of <hi>Rome,</hi> charg'd the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians with it, and put them to horrible Torments. He takes occaſion from thence to ſpeak of the Origin of Chriſtianity in theſe Words:<note n="*" place="margin">Annal. lib. 15. c. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>The Author of that Sect is</hi> Chriſt, <hi>who was put to Death under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of</hi> Tiberius <hi>by</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of</hi> Judea. <hi>That pernicious Superſtition, tho ſuppreſs'd in the beginning, quickly broke out again, and ſpread it ſelf not only through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> Judea, <hi>the Place where this Evil had its Origin, but alſo in</hi> Rome, <hi>whither every vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous and ſhameful thing reſorts, and finds Abettors. Thoſe who confeſs'd that</hi> they were Chriſtians, <hi>were preſently ſeiz'd, and then a great multitude of People, whom they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, but were not convicted of being Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, ſo much as they were run down by the Hatred that all Men bore againſt them.</hi> It appears from hence that <hi>Tacitus,</hi> tho a Man of Senſe, was not at the pains to know what Chriſtianity was, of which he ſpeaks after a moſt abſurd manner. 'Tis a ſhameful Effect of his Negligence, as I have obſerv'd elſewhere, and perhaps of the Roman Vanity, which deſpis'd every thing, except the Learning of the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> But two things may be obſerv'd in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:59986:151"/>thoſe Words: One is the Truth of the Fact, which the Evangeliſts teach us, that there was one <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the Time of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> who was look'd upon as the <hi>Christ</hi> or <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> put to Death: The other is, that the Chriſtians were not found guilty of the Fire of <hi>Rome,</hi> and could not be put to Death, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> believes, but upon that Accuſation which concern'd alſo the Jews, <hi>viz. That they were Enemies to Mankind.</hi> The Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of<note n="†" place="margin">See <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> upon this Place.</note> 
                  <hi>Tacitus.</hi> have ſhew'd that that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian confounded the Jews with the Chriſtians. As it was but too true that the Jews were Enemies to other Men, ſo nothing can be more abſurd than to accuſe the Chriſtians of it, who had drawn on themſelves the Hatred of the Jews, by maintaining that all Men are Brethren, and freely converſing with all Nations.</p>
               <p>We have alſo the Teſtimony of another contemporary Author, and a Friend of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> but who was ſomewhat more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to know the Opinions of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. 'Tis<note n="‖" place="margin">Ep. lib. 10. Ep. 97.</note> 
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> the younger, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proconſul of <hi>Bithynia,</hi> about ſeventy Years after <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was Governour of <hi>Judea,</hi> ſearch'd out, by <hi>Trajan</hi>'s Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the Chriſtians who were in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and would know what Opinions they had. Afterwards he wrote to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> about it, in a Letter, which is extant ſtill: <hi>They affirm'd,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that all their
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:59986:151"/>Crime and Error conſiſted in their uſing to meet at Night, on a certain day, and ſing together a Hymn to</hi> CHRIST <hi>as to a</hi> GOD; <hi>that they bound themſelves by an Oath indeed not to perpetrate any Crime, but to commit no Theft, nor Robbery, nor Adultery, to deceive no body, to deny no Truſt: afterwards they went to eat together, which they did in common, without any harm; but that they had left off doing it after my Edict, whereby, according to your Orders, I had forbidden all ſorts of Fraterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Wherefore I thought it was neceſſary to extort the Truth by Torments from two Maids who were ſaid to be Deaconeſſes: But I have only found a ſtrange and exceſſive Superſtition. Pliny</hi> as well as <hi>Tacitus</hi> calls <hi>Superſtition</hi> ſome Opinions contrary to thoſe of the Romans, according to the Cuſtom of that time.</p>
               <p>Two ſuch Witneſſes can't be rejected, who certainly favour'd not the Chriſtians, and the firſt whereof acknowledges ſome Facts that were known to every body: and the other relates what he knew from two Chriſtian Women whom he put to the Rack. The Writings we have of the Chriſtians who liv'd from the time of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Pilate</hi> to <hi>Trajan</hi>'s, tell us alſo the ſame things. They refer the beginning of Chriſtianity to that CHRIST whom <hi>Pilate</hi> put to Death; and they ſay, that they had preciſely the ſame Morals. This we ſee not only in the Writings of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:59986:152"/>and Evangeliſts, but alſo in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of St. <hi>Barnabas,</hi> in that of St. <hi>Clemens,</hi> in the Books of <hi>Hermas,</hi> and the genuine Epiſtles of St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> and St. <hi>Polycarp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It muſt therefore be granted, that under the Empire of <hi>Tiberius</hi> there was a Man in <hi>Judea</hi> who gave a beginning to the Chriſtian Religion, and preach'd moſt excellent Morals. All the Chriſtians who liv'd ſince atteſt it from Age to Age, and no body did ever doubt of it; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themſelves don't deny it.</p>
               <p>To be certain whether the Apoſtles and other Primitive Chriſtians were ſincere Perſons, or whether there was any Reaſon to ſuſpect their Honeſty, let us ſee what ſort of Men they were. Let us examin the Letter which St. <hi>Clemens,</hi> Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> wrote to that of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> about forty Years after the Death of Chriſt, or in the beginning of the Empire of <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> We ſee in that whole Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle a Spirit of Peace, Charity, Humility, and very preſſing Exhortations to obey the Morals of the Goſpel. He ſeverely chides thoſe who obſerve them not, and praiſes the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for having conform'd their Actions to its Precepts during ſome time. One may ſee the beginning of his Epiſtle, wherein he bears witneſs<note n="*" place="margin">§. 2.</note> to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of <hi>Corinth; That they had labour'd Day and Night for all the Brethren, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Elect of God might be preſerv'd with
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:59986:152"/>Mercy and Conſcience; that they had been ſincere, without Malice, and without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the Harm they might have done one to another; that all Liviſions and Schiſms were abhorr'd by them; that they were ſorrowful for the Faults of their Neighbours; that they look'd upon their Wants as their own; that they never repented of having done well, but were always ready to do all manner of good Works; that in their Conduct full of Vertue and worthy of Reſpect, they did every thing in the Fear of God, whoſe Commands were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their Hearts.</hi> Nay, he ſays towards the end, <hi>that he knew many Chriſtians who put themſelves in Chains to redeem others; and that many having ſold themſelves to be Slaves, had fed others with the Price of their own Liberty.</hi> His whole Letter is full of the like Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Clemens</hi> had for his Maſters the Apoſtles of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S OF NAZARETH,</hi> who firſt taught Chriſtianity, and he bears them witneſs of a great Piety. If we read their Writings, we ſhall find nothing in them but what breathes a great Reſpect for the Deity, an extreme Love to all Men, and an extraordinary Modeſty in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever relates to a Man's Behaviour towards himſelf. Let any of theſe Writings be pitch'd upon, nothing will be found in it but what tends to Piety and Charity. If ſome of their Writings have been contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, let us take thoſe that were never
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:59986:153"/>doubted of; or, if you pleaſe, thoſe which were quoted by St. <hi>Clemens,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel, and the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> and we ſhall find in them the ſame Morals, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to infuſe into the Minds of their Diſciples.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Apoſtles therefore, by exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all thoſe that would hear them, to live after a manner ſo rational and ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to human Society, could not be ſuſpected thereby of want of Sincerity. But it will perhaps be ſaid, that they preach'd that Doctrine only to inſinuate themſelves into the Minds of the People; and then under pretence of Piety to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from them what they deſir'd. But it muſt be granted me, that this is a mere Suſpicion, not at all grounded upon the Doctrine they taught, ſeeing they condemn alike the unlawful Love of Riches, Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Pleaſures, and all ſorts of Fraud and Cheat. Not one Place of their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings can be quoted that favours Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Covetouſneſs, or Voluptuouſneſs.</p>
               <p>This being ſo, that Suſpicion can be grounded but upon one of theſe two things, <hi>viz.</hi> either that the Apoſtles could expect ſome Advantage by their Doctrine, if it were generally embrac'd, or that they actually got ſome by it, as ſoon as they began to preach it. I call <hi>Advantage</hi> a Good greater in it ſelf than all the Toils
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:59986:153"/>and Dangers which the Apoſtles expos'd themſelves to by preaching the Goſpel, or at leaſt which they thought to be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. 'Tis not likely, that if they were Deceivers, they would not propoſe to themſelves a greater Advantage than the Trouble they were at. Otherwiſe we ſhould look upon them as mad Men, which can't be ſuppos'd without Extravagancy, by thoſe who have read their Writings.</p>
               <p>But the Apoſtles could not expect any Advantage from their Doctrine, but on ſuppoſition that moſt of thoſe to whom they preach'd it would embrace it. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they could expect but a perpetual Perſecution; for none but a mad Man would have expected to live quietly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men extremely conceited of ſome Opinions contrary to thoſe he profeſſes, who think themſelves oblig'd both for the Good of the State, and the Intereſt of their Religion, to take away the Eſtates and Lives of thoſe who oppoſe their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, ſuch as were generally the <hi>Romans, Grecians</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> in the time of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>They expected then that their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would be ſo ſucceſsful as to work upon the greateſt part of Mankind? But this they could not expect, if they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little acquainted with the State wherein thoſe Nations ſubject to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire then were. The Jews were
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59986:154"/>ſo addicted to their Traditions and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and beſides ſo<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> in the Hiſtory of that time.</note> corrupt in their Manners, that there was no likelihood of freeing them from their Prejudices and Vices. The Romans and Grecians were either Atheiſts or ſuperſtitious; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſo given to their Pleaſures, ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and ambitious, that the ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who had not loſt all Senſe<note n="‖" place="margin">Vid. Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſt. in Bel. Catilin. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necam Ep. 7. Quaeſt. Nat. lib. 4. Praefat. &amp; paſſim Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium, &amp;c.</note> of Vertue, ſpeak with Horror and Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Manners of their Time. The Hiſtory of both repreſents to us, in the Events of that time, an Image of the moſt horrible Corruption that ever was, if we judg of it according to the Goſpel-Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. After what has been ſaid, can any Man fancy that the Apoſtles hop'd to get their Opinions embrac'd by moſt of thoſe who liv'd in their time? How could they expect that Men ſo blinded by their Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and hardn'd in their Crimes, would ever embrace Opinions that are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to them? Indeed the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles openly ſaid after their Maſter, that they expected not a great number of Men would receive their Doctrine, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who ſhould remain in their Unbelief.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing the Apoſtles Simplicity had made them hope to convert the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of the Roman Empire, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence would have ſoon undeceiv'd them, ſeeing after having preach'd during many
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59986:154"/>Years, they were oblig'd to acknowledg, that they had converted but few People. The Roman Hiſtory plainly teaches us, that during three hundred Years after the Beginning of Chriſtianity, the number of Chriſtians was far leſs than that of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens in the Roman Empire. Thus the Apoſtles were neceſſarily expos'd to a cruel Perſecution during their whole Life. Being deſpis'd and hated by the Jews and Heathens alike, they could have no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that might be compar'd with their Labours, and the Dangers they were in every Minute. Hence it is that they<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.19.</note> themſelves ſay they expected all ſorts of Miſery in this Life. They were not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, ſeeing after an infinite number of Sufferings they were cruelly put to Death, maintaining ſtill the Truth of the Doctrine they had preach'd.<note n="†" place="margin">§. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>'Tis out of an unjuſt Envy,</hi> ſays <hi>Clemens,</hi> whom I have cited already, <hi>that</hi> Peter <hi>ſuffer'd not one or two, but ſeveral Pains; and having undergone Martyrdom, is gone into the Place of Glory, which was due to him. 'Tis out of Envy that</hi> Paul <hi>got the Price of Patience. Having been put ſeven times in Irons, whipt and ſton'd; being the Herald of the Goſpel in the</hi> Eaſt <hi>and</hi> Weſt, <hi>he made his Faith famous. Having taught the whole World Juſtice, and being come to the Extremity of the Weſt, when he had ſuffer'd Martyrdom before the Chief of the State, he went out of the World.</hi>

               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:59986:155"/>
               <p>That Event of the Apoſtles Preaching deſtroys altogether the ſecond thing on which the Suſpicion of their want of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity might have been grounded. If they were eſteem'd by a ſmall number of Men,<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> 1 Cor. 1.26.</note> moſt of them of a low Condition, they were deſpis'd by the reſt of Men, Jews and Heathens; ill-treated and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, ſuffer'd an extreme Poverty, and at laſt died by the Hands of publick Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, as I have ſhew'd by <hi>Clemens</hi>'s Words, and as all their other Diſciples affirm it. One of the Apoſtles teaches us the ſame thing, when he ſays in one of his Epiſtles;<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.11.</note> 
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto this preſent Hour, we both hunger and thirſt, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain Dwelling-place: and labour, working with our own Hands.</hi>

                  <hi>If in this Life only we have Hope, we are of all Men moſt miſerable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly no Man of Senſe would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Execration of moſt Men, by maintaining a Forgery, to be eſteem'd by ſome few who have no Credit or Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor would he be<note n="†" place="margin">Ib. c. 4.9.</note> 
                  <hi>dealt with as thoſe that were appointed to Death</hi> in the <hi>Amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theaters,</hi> to be a Spectate to the People. A Man may be mov'd with the Deſire of Glory, when he conſiders that moſt of thoſe among whom he lives will applaud him; but no body ever thought fit to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to Long-ſufferings, and at laſt to a cruel and ſhameful Death, only
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59986:155"/>to be eſteem'd by very few Men, and be look'd upon as an impious or mad Man by the greateſt part of thoſe among whom he liv'd.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Truth of thoſe Facts can't be deni'd, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apoſtles have preach'd the Doctrine we read in their Books (which Chriſtians profeſs ſtill) under the Empire of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and ſome following Emperors; that they liv'd in Sorrows and Afflictions; and at laſt ſome of them were put to a cruel Death, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Doctrine they taught during many Years.</p>
               <p>If we ſuſpected that the Apoſtles liv'd after a voluptuous manner, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to the Morals they preach'd, we ſhould doubt of the Teſtimony of their firſt Diſciples, who in imitation of their Maſters, as they themſelves ſay, have cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageouſly expos'd themſelves to an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite number of Sufferings, without get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any Advantage by it in this Life.<note n="*" place="margin">§. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>To thoſe Men,</hi> ſays <hi>Clemens,</hi> ſpeaking of St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul, who liv'd after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine manner, a great multitude of the Elect were join'd, who having undergone ſeveral Torments, were a moſt noble Example amongst us.</hi> It would be one of the greateſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities to ſay that the Apoſtles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Men muſt ſuffer for Religion, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to the Practice of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Vertues, and yet living at eaſe,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:59986:156"/>without caring to practiſe the Precepts they gave to others, but as far as it might ſerve to cheat the World, made a great number of Diſciples, not only ſincere Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators of the ſeeming Vertues of their Maſters, but ready to die, and who really died for a Doctrine, for which thoſe of whom they learn'd it would ſuffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>One may eaſily conceive that ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Perſons may be as ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of a Lie, as we are of the moſt evident Truths, and do conſequently, to maintain a Falſhood, whatever the moſt reſolute Men can do for the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Truths. But one can't apprehend that Men who have imbib'd from their Childhood ſome Opinions altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to thoſe of the Apoſtles, ſuffer'd themſelves to be ſeduc'd; ſo that after they embrac'd their Doctrine, they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the moſt cruel Torments for it, tho they never ſaw their Maſters ſuffer any thing for it. But it appears from the Paſſage I have quoted out of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> that in the beginning of Chriſtianity a great many People declar'd themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, tho they ſaw that the publick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Chriſtian Religion ſhould expoſe them to the Puniſhments inflicted upon Incendiaries. It appears alſo from <hi>Pliny,</hi> that ſome Chriſtian Women ſuffer'd to be put to the rack for their Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:59986:156"/>without accuſing the Chriſtians of any thing. From whence it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that ſome of the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel gave an Example to others, as their Diſciples affirm it. One can't ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend otherwiſe how they could get their Doctrine receiv'd by ſo many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who ſuffer'd horrible Torments for the Religion they learn'd of them.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid I only draw this Conſequence, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apoſtles were ſincere Men, as well as thoſe, who, following their Example, died for the ſame Doctrine. The Apoſtles having been therefore undeniably ſincere Men, it muſt be further confeſs'd, that if there ever were any Men whoſe Vertue deſerv'd our Eſteem, they are they. One can't think of a Deſign more uſeful to Mankind than theirs, as I have ſhew'd already, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Morals they preach'd. No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy could endeavour to make it ſucceed with greater Zeal and Ardour, than they who ſacrific'd to it their Repoſe, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Eſtates, hopes of raiſing themſelves, Honour, and Life it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now I ask, whether being convinc'd of the Probity and Sincerity of the Apoſtles, and knowing beſides from their Diſcourſes that they were far from being mad Men, we may juſtly refuſe to believe their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, when they affirm they have ſeen ſome Facts which they relate with a vaſt
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59986:157"/>number of Circumſtances, and heard ſome Diſcourſes which they ſet down from the beginning to the end, and which are full of Senſe? Let every one put the Queſtion to himſelf, whether he would not believe a Friend of his, whom he knew to be a ſincere and judicious Man, if he affirm'd he had heard and ſeen ſeveral things which he relates, without having any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to deceive him? Could he look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Teſtimony of a Man of Senſe, who ſhould give all imaginable Marks of Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as a Lie, if he affirm'd he had heard a Friend of his ſay ſomething, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards had been preſent at his Torments and Death? I confeſs that thoſe who knew not his Sincerity and Judgment, and that he had no Intereſt to tell a Lie, might doubt of what they ſhould hear him ſay; but I affirm, that being perſwaded of his Honeſty and Wiſdom, it were impoſſible not to believe him. Every one may be convinc'd of it by his Experience, and may imagin a thouſand Examples of what I ſaid.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles tell us they liv'd ſome Years with JESUS of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> of whom they learn'd all their Doctrine; that they ſaw him crucifi'd on ſuch a day, giving up the Ghoſt upon the Croſs, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards buri'd in a Sepulcher digg'd in a Rock by a Jewiſh Counſellor, whoſe Name was <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> who obtain'd
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:59986:157"/>from <hi>Pilate</hi> leave to bury <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and who having put him in a Sepulcher, caus'd a great Stone to be roll'd at the Entrance; that they ſaw ſome Roman Souldiers guard that Sepulcher, which the Chief of the Jews had ſeal'd, leſt the Body of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> ſhould be taken away. Can we, being perſwaded, as we are, of the Sincerity of the Apoſtles, and having ſo ſtrong Proofs of it, refuſe to believe them in this? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we ſhould be out of our Wits, did we believe that wiſe and ſincere Men would tell a Lie, when they affirm a Fact of that Nature with ſo many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. We cannot forbear having the ſame Thoughts concerning the Diſcourſes of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> which the ſame Apoſtles relate with ſo many Circumſtances, that we could not relate them better, if we had heard them. 'Tis as clear as the Noon-light to thoſe who are perſwaded that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were Men who had at leaſt common Senſe and Honeſty, that they ſaid Truth concerning the Facts I have mention'd.</p>
               <p n="9">9. This being ſo, we can have no good Reaſon not to believe them when they affirm they have often ſeen their Maſter heal in a moment incurable Diſeaſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore dead Men to Life, and himſelf rais'd at laſt, after he had been above thirty Hours in his Sepulchre, and then ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eating with them during many Days, and at laſt aſcending to Heaven in
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59986:158"/>a Cloud, in their Preſence. I know that ſeveral Men, who perhaps had never doubted of the Truth of the Apoſtles Teſtimony, if they had ſaid nothing of the Miracles, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, doubt of it only for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. They could have eaſily believ'd that a Man nam'd JESUS taught the Morals we find in the Goſpel in <hi>Judea,</hi> when <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was Governour of it, and that the Jews oblig'd the Roman Governour to put him to Death out of Envy and Malice; and that his Diſciples went on after his Death and taught his Doctrine, and that the moſt cruel Torments could not hinder them from preaching it. They would praiſe the whole Doctrine of Chriſt as the moſt excellent Philoſophy that ever was taught among Men, and which contains the beſt Principles that can be thought of, to oblige them to live well one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But they perſwade themſelves, that the Apoſtles were Impoſtors, only becauſe they ſay they ſaw their Maſter work Miracles, that he was ſeen by them after their Reſurrection, and aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven in their ſight. Let's ſee why they do ſo.</p>
               <p>The Falſity of a Hiſtory can be known but two ways. Firſt, when we perceive that the Witneſſes who relate it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd themſelves, or deſign'd to deceive others, tho what they relate be very poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59986:158"/>Secondly, when we know by clear and evident Arguments that the Facts in queſtion are abſolutely impoſſible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>I have clearly ſhew'd that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles deſign'd not to deceive others, and it can't be ſaid that they themſelves were always deceiv'd in all the Miracles they relate. If the Queſtion was about a ſmall number of Miracles, difficult to examin, one might have ſuch a Suſpicion with ſome likelihood; but they relate ſo many, and of ſo many ſorts, that if what they ſay be not true, they muſt neceſſarily have been Deceivers. For example, they could not be impos'd upon by Chriſt's Aſcenſion into Heaven, which they conſtantly preach'd, and of which the Chriſtians made from the beginning one of the chief Articles of their Faith. Thoſe who, as <hi>Pliny</hi> relates it, ſung Hymns to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as to a God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd without doubt that he aſcended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven. If we read only St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 24. 1 Cor. 15.</note> Goſpel, and the firſt Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> which contain ſeveral particular Circumſtances of many Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Chriſt, eſpecially of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and his ſeveral Apparitions after he came out of his Grave, we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know that thoſe who ſpoke ſo, were not ſeduc'd; and that if what they ſay is not true, they muſt neceſſarily have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to deceive thoſe to whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59986:159"/>ſuch Facts. But I have undeniably ſhew'd, that the Apoſtles were ſincere Men, and conſequently that their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony can't be rejected.</p>
               <p>Wherefore thoſe who believe it not, accuſe them not of having ſuffer'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſeduc'd, neither do they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to overthrow the Arguments by which we prove the Apoſtles Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. They are contented to offer ſome Objections concerning the Nature of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and ſo confine themſelves to the ſecond way of knowing the Falſity of a Fact, which conſiſts in diſcovering that 'tis a thing abſolutely impoſſible.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall ſpeak of this in another Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein I ſhall explain the Nature of Miracles.</p>

                  <hi>LETTER II.</hi> Wherein is ſhew'd what a Miracle is, and that we ought to conclude from thoſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that they were truly ſent of God.</head>
               <p n="1">1. SIR, I promis'd you to diſcourſe of the Nature of Miracles, and I muſt perform my Promiſe, ſeeing without it I ſhould but half prove the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. 'Tis not enough to believe that the general Doctrines of Chriſtianity are true and agreeable to Reaſon; we muſt be alſo perſwaded that they are of Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and this we learn from the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of thoſe who firſt preach'd them. That is the <hi>Seal</hi> whereby we clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. To ſhew that it was reveal'd by the ſame God who made Heaven and Earth, and gave to Nature the Laws, according to which natural Cauſes act; they have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten deſir'd him to ſuſpend the Effects of thoſe Laws, tho unavoidable; at their Prayers they were ſuſpended, and the contrary of what the Experience of all
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59986:160"/>Ages had obſerv'd hitherto, and of what we ſtill ſee, happen'd then. That's an undeniable Proof, not only of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines being agreeable to the Will and Deſigns of the Maker of all Things, as it ſeems to be if it be merely conſider'd in it ſelf, but alſo of their having an expreſs Order from God to publiſh it among Men.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I'll ſhew firſt, what a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is, and how true Miracles may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from falſe ones. Secondly, I'll enquire into the Author of them, and what Conſequence may be drawn from them. Laſtly, I ſhall ſay ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Extent of Miracles, and their different kinds. I'll ſhew at the ſame time the Truth of the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and I ſhall anſwer ſome Objections of Unbelievers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To look upon an extraordinary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as a Miracle, and draw any Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from it; Firſt, it muſt be a thing above the Power of Men. Secondly, it ought to be above the ordinary Courſe of Nature, or corporeal Cauſes; and above the Strength of humane Souls; for <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or <hi>natural Cauſes,</hi> and the <hi>Order</hi> or <hi>the Laws of Nature,</hi> are nothing but the Souls and Bodies of Men, other Bodies, and the Laws according to which they conſtantly act, without being able to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them. Thirdly, he in whoſe Behalf
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59986:160"/>that thing is done, ought to know it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, or at leaſt it muſt happen when he wants it. I ſhall examin thoſe three things one after another; for the whole Strength of the Proofs which can be fetch'd from Miracles depends upon it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are ſome Divines who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that a Miracle is only the Effect of an infinite Power, and conſequently that God only is the Author of it; ſo that it is not only above the Power of Men, but alſo above that of all other Creatures. I ſhall ſpeak of that hereafter. 'Tis enough to obſerve here, that nothing which Men are able to do, can be look'd upon as a miraculous thing. Wherefore to be ſure whether what is vented as a Miracle is really ſo, the firſt thing that is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, is, whether Men can do it. For if it appears that it is not above the Power of Men, there would be no reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that it is an extraordinary Effect of God's Power, or of ſome other intelligent Being.</p>
               <p>Thus if a Man ſhew'd an uſual Skill in Swimming, and boaſted of it as of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous thing, he might be juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an Impoſtor, becauſe one may by Uſe get a Skill in Swimming, which ſeems wonderful to thoſe who have it not. But if any body walk'd upon the Water as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Land, without ſinking in the leaſt, it could not be doubted that he did a thing
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59986:161"/>which is above all the Strength and Skill of Men, provided he had nothing under his Feet that might be ſeen, or elſewhere, to uphold him. Every one knows that there being a certain Relation of <hi>Gravity</hi> between humane Bodies and Water, the Laws of Nature allow not that a Man ſhould ſtand upon the Water. So that if it appears that any body walk'd upon the Water as upon the Land, without having under his Feet, or elſewhere, any thing to hold him ſo, it muſt be granted that a Power greater than that of Men acted in his behalf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But becauſe there are an infinite number of natural Cauſes which Men make uſe of to produce ſome Effects, which they themſelves cannot produce by their mere Skill and Strength; a thing, to be look'd upon as miraculous, ought not to be done by any other natural Cauſe, ſuch as are the Bodies which ſurround us. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, great Weights, which would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſink if they were thrown into the Water, will lie upon it without ſinking, if a Body much lighter than Water, as Wood, be put between the Water and thoſe Weights. There is nothing mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous in that, becauſe it is done by a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal and known Cauſe. But it could not be deni'd to be a miraculous thing, if a Man ſhould walk upon the Water as I have ſaid.</p>
               <pb n="311" facs="tcp:59986:161"/>
               <p>When a learned Phyſician cures a ſick Perſon with ſome Remedies, after he has ſpent a long time in ſtudying the Nature of Diſeaſes, and the Effects of Remedies, that Cure is not look'd upon as a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; 'tis aſcrib'd to the natural Effect of the Remedies which have been well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pli'd. But if we ſhould ſee a Man, who only by touching all ſorts of ſick Perſons, or by ſpeaking to them, without uſing any ſenſible Remedy, cures them upon the ſpot, that Effect could be aſcrib'd only to ſome ſupernatural Cauſes.</p>
               <p>Some<note n="*" place="margin">Spinoſa in Tract. Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co-Polit. cap. 6.</note> Unbelievers have endeavour'd to make that Character of Miracles uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, by ſaying that we know not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly natural Cauſes and their Effects, as to be able to diſtinguiſh what they can produce, from what is above their Strength. Nay, they pretend that what is call'd Miraculous ſhould only be look'd upon as an extraordinary or rare Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and the Effect of natural Cauſes, which were not well known. But tho it be very true, that we are very far from having a perfect Knowledg of natural Cauſes, yet it is not leſs certain that we know moſt certainly ſome things by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, eſpecially when that Experience is common and eaſy. For example, we perfectly know that no Man can ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Water ſo as to touch it only with the Sole of his Feet, without uſing the
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59986:162"/>help of any other Body for it. If any one ſhould ſay that it may be ſuch a thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd ſometimes by an extraordinary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſome natural Cauſes which we know not; it is certain that ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture could only be heard as a Propoſition which is not contradictory, but is not the leſs falſe for that, as the Experience of all Mankind teaches us. Indeed thoſe who uſe that Argument to make Miracles doubtful, do it only to perplex ſimple Men who hear them. They know very well that we are perfectly ſure of ſome things, and that they can't be made doubtful, by ſaying only that 'tis not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory that the contrary be true. If they durſt deny the miraculous Effects on which Religion is grounded, they would roundly do it, and not have recourſe to Objections ſo little judicious; but not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to do it, and being not able to make the contrary of what we believe look pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, they confine themſelves to ſome ſuch Objections. I ſhall not undertake now to confute all their particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, becauſe the Principles I lay down deſtroy them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. 'Tis therefore certain that we may know ſome things are above the Power of Men, and can't be the Effect of any other natural or corporeal Cauſe; and that if we ſee ſome happen, or learn from faithful Witneſſes that there happen'd ſome, we
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59986:162"/>may ſay, without being miſtaken, that they are miraculous things. Such is, for example, the Action of walking upon the Water, and curing all manner of Diſeaſes without Remedies.</p>
               <p>However, to draw any Conſequences from a miraculous Fact in the behalf of any body, he ought to know before-hand that that Miracle will happen; or at leaſt it muſt happen juſt when 'tis neceſſary, for otherwiſe it would be inſignificant. If when no body thinks of it there happen'd a thing wherein neither Men nor other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes had a hand, and no body knew of what uſe it would be, nothing could be concluded from it; and he who ſhould ſay that it happen'd in his behalf, ought to be ſuſpected of Fraud.</p>
               <p>Some<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See my Diſſertation</hi> De Traje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctu maris Idumaei.</note> Hiſtorians, for inſtance, tell us that <hi>Alexander</hi> going to meet <hi>Darius,</hi> led part of his Troops to paſs at the foot of Mount <hi>Climax,</hi> where there was no Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage when the South Wind blew, becauſe the Sea cover'd that way; and that as ſoon as he came thither the North blew, ſo that they went through it. Not to ſay the Change of Wind at that time might be natural, I affirm that <hi>Alexander</hi> having not known it before, and being able to go another way, it can't be look'd upon as a Miracle, which Providence wrought in his behalf; nor can it be concluded from it, that Heaven approv'd his Deſigns.</p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:59986:163"/>
               <p>To give another Example fetch'd from the Hiſtory of the ſame Prince,<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. Q. Curt. lib. 10. c. 10.</note> 'tis ſaid that his Corps remain'd ſeven Days at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> before it was embalm'd, without ſmelling ill in the leaſt; nor had his Face a different Colour than what it had whilſt he was alive, tho it be extremely hot in that Climate wherein <hi>Babylon</hi> was ſituated. Let us ſuppoſe not only the Truth of that Fact, but alſo that natural Cauſes had no hand in it; 'tis manifeſt that nothing can be concluded from ſuch a thing either for or againſt <hi>Alexander.</hi> For indeed what could the inviſible Power mean by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Body of <hi>Alexander</hi> from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption during ſeven Days? None but that Power can teach it; and if any one had undertaken to make his advantage of it, he had been juſtly laugh'd at.</p>
               <p>That Character of a true Miracle alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deſtroys the Objection I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed already: for if miraculous Facts were extraordinary Effects of natural but unknown Cauſes, 'tis manifeſt they could not be foreſeen. No Man can foreſee a thing which ſcarce ever happens, and is the Effect of ſome Cauſes which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to him, unleſs that Man be warn'd of it by an Effect of the ſame Cauſes, which is to ſuppoſe without reaſon a thing altogether incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Wherefore if we can ſhew that there happen'd ſome things that neither Men
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59986:163"/>nor other natural Cauſes could do, which notwithſtanding were foretold by thoſe in whoſe behalf they were done; it muſt be granted us, that they are miraculous Facts which happen'd in the behalf of thoſe who foretold them. The Goſpels are full of the like Miracles, but I ſhall only pitch upon one, to apply what has been ſaid to it. It is of of great moment, that if it be granted that 'tis true, the reſt can't be deni'd. I mean <hi>the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> wherein we ſee all the Characters of a true Miracle. Firſt, 'tis certain by the Experience of all Ages, that no Man, or any other natural Cauſe, can reſtore a dead Man to Life. Tho the humane Body is not perfectly known to us, no more than the Virtue of an infinite number of things, yet we may affirm without Raſhneſs, that no body raiſes himſelf, nor by his own Virtue, or that of any other thing. One can't affirm the contrary without being look'd upon as a mad Man among all the Nations in the World. Secondly, Jeſus Chriſt<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 16.21. &amp; 17.23. &amp; 26.61. &amp; 27.63.</note> often foretold his Reſurrection, and ſaid it ſhould happen on the third Day. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from thence before-hand, that Men would be oblig'd to believe that he was ſent by God, his Reſurrection being the greateſt <hi>Sign</hi> of it that could be ask'd.<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 12.39, 40.</note> 
                  <hi>An evil and adulterous Generation,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſeeks after a Sign, and there ſhall no
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:59986:164"/>Sign be given to it, but the Sign of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> Jonas; <hi>for as</hi> Jonas <hi>was three Days and three Nights in the Whale's Belly, ſo ſhall the Son of Man be three Days and three Nights in the Heart of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Apoſtles were ſincere Men, and were not deceiv'd, that Fact is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and conſequently it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd that he who rais'd Jeſus Chriſt, bare him a Teſtimony which can't be doubted of. I have ſhew'd in the foregoing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the Apoſtles were ſincere Men, and could not be deceiv'd on that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Their Maſter was not hid in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when it was ſaid that he was dead; 'twas upon a Croſs, and in a publick Place, ſurrounded with Roman Souldiers. He had been buri'd, his Enemies ſeal'd his Sepulcher; they ſet a Guard of Souldiers about it, and he was above four and twenty Hours in it. Therefore no body could doubt of his being truly dead, and his Apoſtles did not queſtion it. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they ſaw him ſeveral times, touch'd him, ſpoke with him, and ate with him; ſo that they could not be miſtaken in it. Wherefore if the thing had not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, it were not poſſible to vindicate their Sincerity; and if they were ſincere Men, which they certainly were, as has been ſhew'd, the Truth of the Fact can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted of.</p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:59986:164"/>
               <p n="7">7. The more we examin their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the more we ſhall be convinc'd of it; and without inſiſting longer upon that, I had rather obſerve, againſt thoſe who acknowledg a God and a Providence, that what may be ſaid of feign'd Miracles can't be objected againſt that Miracle and other Miracles of Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no great likelihood that God would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Order of Nature for ſo inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Matters as thoſe are for which he is ſaid to diſturb it every day. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers who liv'd in the Apoſtles time, and had not attentively conſider'd the Circumſtances which attend the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, might perhaps have ſaid then that they apprehended not how Providence was ſo much concern'd in the Eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, as to work an infinite number of Miracles in its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, ſeeing it made ſo little a Progreſs in the World. But thoſe who live now can't raiſe the like Objections againſt us, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen the Duration and Progreſs of the Chriſtian Religion. If it has not produc'd yet among Men all the Effects it ſhould have produc'd, if they had known their true Intereſt, it can't be ſaid that ſuch a thing will never happen hereafter. Thoſe who would have conjectur'd at the beginning of Chriſtianity, that it ſhould always be a contemptible Sect, becauſe it was then deſpis'd, would have been groſly
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59986:165"/>miſtaken, as we ſee at preſent; and the Knowledg we have of the Time paſt ought to make us reſerv'd with reſpect to the future.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Let us ſee now what is the efficient and immediate Cauſe of Miracles. We have ſeen already, that they are neither Men, nor other Bodies, which act accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Order of Nature. It muſt be therefore ſome inviſible Power, that is, either ſome intelligent Beings more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than we, tho they are created, or elſe God himſelf.</p>
               <p>Some believe, as I ſaid already, that Miracles are the Effects of an infinite Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and there is no doubt but God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wrought ſeveral Miracles: but the Queſtion is, whether they are all above the Strength of all other Creatures; ſo that they have no other efficient and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Cauſe but God himſelf. To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that intelligent Beings, more perfect than we are, can work Miracles, we ſhould exactly know what is the Extent of their Power, and diſtinctly ſee that Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are above it. 'Tis true we know they are above the Laws of Nature, which God eſtabliſh'd from the beginning; but we know not whether he gives not to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels the Power of altering ſometimes that Order. Tho it be originally the Effect of an infinite Power, it follows not that none but an infinite Power can make ſome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59986:165"/>in it, if the Power which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd it will permit it. We can't there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay that Angels work no Miracles; in effect it appears from ſacred Hiſtory that God often made uſe of them when Miracles were wrought. But I will not inſiſt upon it, becauſe it belongs not to my Subject.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It will perhaps be ask'd, ſuppoſing Angels work Miracles; Firſt, how one may know whether 'tis God or an Angel that wrought a certain Miracle. And, Secondly, how one may know that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle was done by a good or bad Angel.</p>
               <p>A Miracle being not of a Nature which neceſſarily requires a Cauſe, whereof the Power is infinite, I confeſs we ſee no Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in it, if it be conſider'd in it ſelf, whereby we may know whether it was wrought by God or an Angel. But the more we ſee a thing above our Power, the more it ſeems difficult to us, and the more we perſwade our ſelves that 'tis the Effect of an infinite Power. For exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to foretel a contingent Event, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon Mens Will, and which is to happen many Ages after, ſeems to us to be a thing above the Knowledg of created intelligent Beings, tho it be never ſo great. But the raiſing of a Storm, tho the Air is not diſpos'd for it, ſeems not to be a very difficult thing, tho it be above our Power; and we eaſily believe that
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59986:166"/>Angels either good or bad can do it. However it matters little to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God immediately wrought a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or a good Angel, ſeeing 'tis certain good Angels do nothing but what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Will of God, or is an execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Orders. Whether God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf acts, or an Angel, 'tis the ſame thing with reſpect to us, ſeeing we neither ſee the Cauſe that works, nor the manner of its Operation.</p>
               <p>As for the other Queſtion concerning the manner of knowing whether a Miracle was wrought by a good or a bad Angel, one may ſay ſomething more poſitive. Truth being always the ſame contradicts not it ſelf; 'tis a manifeſt Principle to all thoſe who are not <hi>Pyrrhonians.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Miracles of God and good Anglels ought always to tend to the confirming or eſtabliſhing ſome Doctrines agreeable to Truths, that are known either by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or Reaſon, ſeeing 'tis certain that God and good Angels always love the Truth. If we ſee therefore that a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle confirms or eſtabliſhes ſomething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to a certain Truth, we may be ſure that Miracle is an Effect of a Power contrary to that of God and good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. Thus the Deſign of a Miracle diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers its Author. If we can't appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what's the end of a Miracle, we can give no certain Judgment about it, nor
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59986:166"/>draw from it any Conſequence for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Truth.</p>
               <p>A bad Angel being not able to work Miracles which favour Truth and Vertue, all thoſe which contribute to it, ought to be look'd upon as coming from a good Principle. On the contrary, a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel being not able to act for Lies and Vices, all the Miracles which ſhould fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour either of them, ought to be look'd upon as Miracles of bad Angels. This is an infallible Rule to know by what ſort of Angels a Miracles was wrought, ſuppoſing it were known that an Angel was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. If the Miracles of the Goſpel are examin'd according to thoſe Principles, it cannot be deni'd that they were wrought either by God himſelf or good Angels, becauſe their only Aim is to eſtabliſh or ſettle Truth, and lead Men to Vertue. Now this is altogether inconſiſtent with the Notion one may form of a Power which delights in doing ill, and deceiving Men. This Chriſt ſhew'd to the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, who accus'd him of caſting out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, by virtue of a Power he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the Prince of Demons.<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 12.25, 26.</note> 
                  <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Kingdom,</hi> ſays he, <hi>divided againſt it ſelf, is brought to Deſolation; and every City or Houſe divided againſt it ſelf, ſhall not ſtand: and if Satan caſt out Satan, he is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt himſelf; how ſhall then his
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59986:167"/>Kingdom ſtand?</hi> That's a convincing Proof of the Divinity of the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, againſt the Jews, who were ſo extravagant as to aſcribe them to an ill Power, that was an Enemy to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. But becauſe I write not againſt them, I ſhall not longer inſiſt upon it. The Unbelievers who live among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are not more perſwaded of the Power of the Devil, than of God, and deny all ſorts of Miracles alike. But I have ſhew'd, from the Sincerity of the Apoſtles, and the thing it ſelf, that they have no reaſon to deny thoſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Laſtly; If it be conſider'd that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles are the Effects of the Power of God or Angels, one may eaſily apprehend that they are not contradictory things. That which is <hi>contradictory</hi> is the Object of no Power, 'tis a mere Nothing, as all thoſe who know the Meaning of that word will grant it. No poſitive Idea can be form'd of it, and every contradictory Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is unintelligible in it ſelf. If the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles mention'd in Holy Scripture are exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, not one of that Nature will be found among them. There is none but what may be expreſs'd in intelligible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. For example, God can make a Man who liv'd to live no longer; that is, his Blood ſhall no more circulate, and all his Members ſhall ceaſe to perform their Functions. On the Contrary, he
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59986:167"/>can make a Man whoſe Blood was ſettl'd, and whoſe Members perform'd none of their Functions, to begin to live again, as it did before. Thoſe Propoſitions are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily apprehended. But <hi>to make a Man to live and not to live, at the ſame time,</hi> taking the word <hi>to live</hi> in one and the ſame Senſe, is a contradictory thing, which is not the Object of the Divine Power. God never wrought any ſuch Miracles.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who rank among the Miracles of Chriſtianity, that whereby they pretend that God makes a humane Body to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and not extended at the ſame time, and to be in many Places at one time; thoſe Men, I ſay, feign a Miracle, of which they have no Idea, and reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with Words they underſtand not. They aſcribe to the Chriſtian Religion a Myſtery abſurd, and contrary to the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Light to Reaſon and Revelation.</p>
               <p>What I ſaid concerning Miracles has no relation with that, and I pretend not to defend any ſuch thing. My Deſign was to ſhew wherein Miracles conſiſt, to make Unbelievers apprehend that they are very poſſible, that they can't be aſſaulted but by ſhewing that there is an Impoſſibility in the miraculous Facts on which the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion is grounded.</p>
               <p>There is beſides another ſort of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which tho perhaps they happen eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, can't be of any uſe to prove the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:59986:168"/>Truth of the Chriſtian Religion, becauſe they are not ſenſible. God can very often do, either by himſelf or the Miniſtry of Angels, an infinite Number of things without the intervention of natural Cauſes, when he thinks fit, or good Men pray him to do it. But becauſe one can't perceive whether a ſupernatural Cauſe acts or not on thoſe occaſions, becauſe what happens is not in it ſelf above the Strength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Cauſes, and 'tis not known whether they interven'd, it can't be affirm'd that a Miracle was wrought. For example, a ſick Man whom Remedies could not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally cure, is reſtor'd by the Prayers of his Relations, becauſe God or Angels ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what is wanting in the natural Virtue of Remedies. But this can't be affirm'd without a Revelation.</p>
               <p>Hereupon 'tis ask'd, How we come to ſuppoſe that God who works no more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Miracles, according to us, performs every day ſome inviſible ones, ſuch as that which I have deſcrib'd; and why he ſhould be deſir'd to work this kind of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, not thoſe which ſtrike our Senſes? In anſwer to that I ſay, that we can know nothing of God's Conduct but by ſenſible Effects, or a Revelation. Wherefore ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we ſee no more ſuch Miracles as ſtrike our Senſes, we ought to ſay that God will work no more any ſuch Miracles; and if we can give ſome Reaſons of it, which are
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:59986:168"/>not unworthy of God's Wiſdom, nothing can hinder us from alledging them,<note n="*" place="margin">Part II. ch. 6.</note> as I have done elſewhere. On the other hand, Revelation commanding us to offer Prayers to God in our Neceſſities, and aſſuring us that if what we ask is truly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to us, if we ask it as we ought, and it we obey the Precepts of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, we ſhall obtain what we pray for; we have reaſon to ſuppoſe that God will interpoſe after an extraordinary manner, if it be neceſſary, to hear our Prayers, becauſe he promis'd it. But why, will it be ſaid, did God make ſuch Promiſes, which ſuppoſe that he works ſtill ſome Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of this latter ſort, ſeeing he will no more do ſenſible ones? I have ſhew'd already, why he works no more Miracles, that fall under our Senſes, and there is no need I ſhould repeat what I have ſaid about it. As for the other, they are a neceſſary Conſequence of God's Providence, which conſiſts not only in having given ſome Laws to Nature, according to which it acts; but in ſupplying the Defects of thoſe Laws, and making ſuch Exceptions to them as God thinks fit. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Providence exiſts not leſs now than it did formerly, no body ought to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that God works Miracles of that kind. There is nothing in it that's unworthy of him; and ſeeing he promis'd it, it can't be doubted whether he does it, and Men
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59986:169"/>have reaſon to pray to him on that Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. It can't be ſaid that 'tis an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing, and prov'd thereby that our Prayers are uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>I think I have undeniably ſhew'd it, by ſuppoſing that there is a God who made the World, and is conſequently the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Laws of Nature; and that there are ſome other intelligent Beings, who can do what is above the Power of Men. I prov'd the firſt thing in the laſt Chapter of the 2d Part of my Diſcourſe concerning <hi>Incredulity;</hi> and the other can't be doubted of, if we acknowledg the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd with undeniable Miracles.</p>
               <p>Chriſt and his Apoſtles might have made their Doctrine to be admir'd with mere Reaſonings, as we do now; but their Buſineſs was not only to ſhew that they ſaid nothing but what was moſt agreeable to Reaſon; they taught not their Doctrine as mere Philoſophers or Divines, but as Men authoriz'd by Heaven; they were therefore to convince Men that they were ſent from God. To prove it undeniably, there was no better way than to do ſome things above the Laws of Nature, which were ſenſible Signs of God's approving their Doctrine, and whereby they unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably prov'd that they were his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. If they had done or ſaid nothing but what other Men might have done of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59986:169"/>ſaid, they would have been look'd upon as Divines or Philoſophers, who vented their own Thoughts; but when Men ſaw that after they had appeal'd to the Maker of the World for the Truth of what they ſaid, that there happen'd at their Prayers ſome things which are above the Power of all Men and all natural Cauſes; they could not doubt but God declar'd himſelf in their behalf, eſpecially if they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that the Doctrine they preach'd was moſt worthy of him. So that the fineſt Doctrine that ever was, attended with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of Miracles, ought to excite the Attention of all thoſe who were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether blinded by their Vices and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and make them look upon them as the true Miniſters of that God, who cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated the World.</p>
               <p>This is, Sir, what I had to ſay to you concerning Miracles; not to exhauſt the Matter, but only to ſhew the Poſſibility and Truth of thoſe of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. I heartily pray God, that it may contribute to reclaim thoſe who out of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or otherwiſe doubt of the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion. I am, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
